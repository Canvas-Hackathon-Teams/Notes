EXAMPLE #11: FULLY IMMERSED IN MEDIA
====================================

* Phase: Consumption
* Context: Situational

## Background:

Media exists in many different forms including text, pictures, video, and sound. Sometimes media is even touch, taste, or smell-based – think of “scratch and sniff” advertisements, magazine cut-outs, or free samples. Why restrict ourselves to consuming only one form of media at a time? While pulling other forms of media into a story can enhance the consumers experience, oftentimes it can be obtrusive and take away from the narrative.

Think of a way to integrate interviews, movies, music, pictures, sound effects, and more forms of media to add to the experience of consuming media without being distracting. How might we design small story-consumption experiences that use multiple forms of media to enhance understanding of a specific point in a text-based narrative, without being disruptive to the overall experience?

Knight Lab’s SoundCite tool, for example, creates a non-intrusive way for embedding audio clips in text-based news stories. Two different forms of media can be consumed simultaneously and complement each other in a meaningful way. Can similar things be done with video or images or other forms? Are there different ways of doing it with sound?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution where readers could absorb media content through multiple forms and kinds of intake modalities, simultaneously.

## Use Cases:

* Listening on the web: What types of written stories could be enhanced with an exacting audio player placement? What are the elements of any story that must be heard, not read in a description? (e.g. SoundCite helps a storyteller embed an inline audio player so that a reader can listen and can read at the same time, without having to leave an individual paragraph).
* Watching on the web: How can we talk about video content, without having to watch a full video? How can we talk about video content while allowing a viewer to reveal potential spoiler content?
* Interactive storytelling: Media outlets such as the New York Times have been experimenting with multimedia/interactive stories combining text, high-res imagery and mini-videos to tell stories in a more comprehensive way within one single web page, while keeping a high degree of readability. What are new models that expand on this type of multimedia concept and how would they be applied on a mobile platform setting?
 
## Additional Considerations:

* Needs to be useable by a non­technical user
* Needs to help a storyteller make good narrative choices
* Needs to be web-based and produce responsive embed code
