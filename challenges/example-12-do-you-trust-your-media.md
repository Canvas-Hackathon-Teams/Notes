EXAMPLE #12: DO YOU TRUST YOUR MEDIA?
=====================================

* Phase: Consumption
* Context: Editorial

## Background:

How well do you trust your news? Owing to its editorial nature, media rarely if ever conveys the “objective truth” of a situation. Sometimes, particularly to an informed consumer, the “bias” or “slant” of a media outlet or piece of journalism can be quite clear. Other times, the biases are harder to evaluate and can be hidden in factors as nuanced as word choice. Even talented, dedicated journalists are only human – they can make mistakes in their reporting, gather or be given incorrect information, or be burdened with their own subconscious biases just like the rest of us.

Truth, bias, and trust are all closely related. Trustworthiness, much like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. If a news source has a political bias, that may actually make an audience that shares similar political views consider it to be more trustworthy than another differently-biased source. It is often up to the consumer themselves to make their own judgements. But can we explore ways to give media consumers a fuller context with which to make these choices?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution to help media consumers evaluate the possible perceptions of bias, truth, and/or trustworthiness of media. Your solution could evaluate a particular media source as a whole, content from a media source piece-by-piece, content from a specific author/journalist, or media sources in comparison with each other.

## Use Cases:

* “Malmedia plugin”: Many modern web browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox display a warning screen when a user is about to visit a site known to contain malware or security flaws. Create a browser plugin where users could submit reports or evaluations of biased, untrustworthy, or incorrect media sources, authors, or content. Based on these reports, the plugin could warn other users of the potential inaccuracies or biases before they consumed media from these sources or journalists. Rather than having users rate a source as trustworthy or not on a true/false scale, consider allowing ratings based on political opinion. For example, “Example.com is 70% liberal, 30% conservative.”
* Journalists are People Too: Create a solution for tracking facts about journalists which would provide additional context to a media consumer regarding potential biases of specific authors and by-lines. These facts could include data like age, nationality, where the journalist grew up, where they live now, political party affiliation, etc. Consider providing means for a journalist to edit, correct, verify, or respond to the facts that appear in their own profile to guard against vandalism and to provide additional context.
* Language Matters: The way statements and facts are phrased and the choice of words used can hint at the potential bias or trustworthiness of a media source. For example, consider the connotations of “freedom fighter” versus “terrorist”. Create a solution which analyzes which sites use which language to describe particular groups or events. For example, a visualization could be a “wordcloud” partitioned by different sources for the same event. When evaluating media sources covering the American healthcare law, some sources could be using the words “death panel” more often, and others could be using “public option” or “single payer system” with more frequency.
* Compare The Facts: If two news outlets are reporting on the same event, presumably they’re using the same base of facts. Do they both actually have the same set? Or are some facts excluded from Source A vs Source B, which could hint at a possible bias in one or both of the sources? Create a solution that evaluates and compares the facts presented by different media outlets.

## Additional Considerations:

Because perceptions of bias, truth, and trustworthiness vary depending on who the consumer is, focus on giving consumers the additional context they need to make informed decisions about what media they choose to believe and consume, rather than making explicit judgements on the bias, truth, or trustworthiness of media sources.
