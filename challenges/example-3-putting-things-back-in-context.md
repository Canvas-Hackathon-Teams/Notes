EXAMPLE #3: PUTTING THINGS BACK IN CONTEXT
==========================================

* Phase: Production
* Context: Cultural & Historical

## Background:

Journalism touches upon nearly every topic in human societies. Journalists report on events that happen within a deep cultural and historical context. At the same time, journalists are not always natives of the societies they cover. Why are more Chinese moving to urban cities now than ever before? Why did Burger King release a black hamburger in Japan? Why are the Petronas Towers in Malaysia constructed in the shape of a Muslim Rub el Hizb?

How do we enable journalists to quickly and easily identify, research, and bring historical and cultural context into the stories they are writing/producing?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution that can intelligently produce a historical context report on a topic for media producers, based on simple wizard-style prompts. Or, use Natural Language Processing or Artificial Intelligence tools to suggest culturally-relevant data, or to recommend additional topics to research while a journalist is writing/editing a story.

## Use Cases:

Topic Briefing Wizard: Nadia is a news anchor at Al Jazeera, and she is preparing to conduct a live TV interview with a representative of a new NGO on an issue in a country she doesn’t yet know much about. She wants to learn more before the interview so she can be sure to ask pertinent, hard-hitting questions. She opens an “historical/cultural context learning wizard” on her computer and selects from a few straightforward options like the country the interviewee is from, the issue the NGO is addressing, etc. The wizard produces a 2 page PDF report Nadia can print out and skim before her interview, with information about the history of the country, major events that this NGO has played a role in, and details about why this particular issue has arisen in this culture when it hasn’t in neighboring countries. There’s also information about honorifics and how Nadia should respectfully address her interviewee.
Data Suggestion Tool: Waleed is a reporter writing a story about the textile industry in Bangladesh. As he writes paragraphs of the story, his intelligent word processor determines what he is writing about based on key phrases, and suggests visualizations of datasets from the relevant government authorities about the age and gender breakdown of textile factory workers, the major companies in the country and their revenues, etc.
 

## Additional Considerations:

The solution should have a Graphical User Interface and be usable by non-technical users.
Design the tool to be used on a smartphone, for when the journalist is in the field in a new city or country.
