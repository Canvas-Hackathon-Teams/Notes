Phase: Consumption
Context: Situational 


## Background:

Everything happens somewhere, and the news is no exception. Concerts are performed in famous venues, wars shift across landscapes, new startups sprout within established innovation corridors, sports teams create intense regional rivalries, and natural disasters impact locations across the globe. One key contextual component of media is simply knowing where in the world events are happening – relative to other current and past events, where we live or currently are, or compared to other geographic datasets and information entirely.

With billions of place names in the world, understanding the geography of international news is a task made for visualization and mapping. How can we couple advanced geospatial technologies and media content to provide a geographic component to storytelling?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution for mapping out and visualizing or interacting with the geography of media content. This could be a new map-based interface for browsing and consuming content, an innovative way to incorporate maps into an article or story, or a system for extracting geographic information embedded in an article’s text and mapping it.

## Use Cases:

* Historical Wars and Conflicts: Wars are frequently fought over geographic territory, and current conflicts may have been precipitated by events in the past. A solution that fits this use case would produce a graphical representation of historical conflicts. Explore how to tie past battles to current ones, or illustrate the shifting “front lines” of opposing forces over time.
* My Team is Better than Yours: Sports events and leagues often stir strong regional and city-based rivalries. Some events like the Olympics, the Dakar Rally, and Formula 1 racing take place on a global scale. What if we visualized the geolocations of social media posts about each team or event, or the venues and stadiums that teams and athletes compete at? Develop a solution to visualize or interact with the geographic nature of sports fans and competitions.
* Globalization Visualization:  A story about a changing trade relationship, a new political tie, or cultural trend often only provides a glimpse of a larger global geographic development. Create a solution that visualizes and maps interactions between places to add context to a story.

## Additional Considerations:

* Have your solution automatically recognize and pull out geographic information in an article’s text using Natural Language Processing techniques like Named Entity Recognition.
* Recommendation: Provide an interface for a journalist to tag/identify geographic information in a story as they are writing it.
