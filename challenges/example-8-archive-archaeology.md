EXAMPLE #8: ARCHIVE ARCHAEOLOGY
===============================

* Phase: Production
* Context: Situational

## Background:

Media organizations digitally publish lots of content every day, every year. The archives that result are a hugely valuable resource. So much additional context can be derived from what was newsworthy 1, 5, and even 10 years ago.

Similarly, knowledge bases and open data catalogs are tools used in the technology field to archive and organize information and data for easy retrieval.

How can newsrooms better take advantage of available archival content in their news-gathering operations today?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution that uses archival content to provide added context to stories currently being reported or published. Also, think about how your solution could offer a more convenient, more automated, or quicker way for journalists and media producers to retrieve archived content related to new content as it is in production.

## Use Cases:

* Stories through the Ages: The Oxford English Dictionary defines words by quoting examples of their usage throughout history. Create a solution that can take a newsworthy word, subject, or phrase like “Tahrir Square” or “European Union” or “Affordable Care Act” and pull up an historical list of mentions of this event or subject from an organization’s media archives.
Real-Time API: Journalists often need to include facts and figures in their stories like population numbers, electricity per capita, passengers traveling by air from a particular airport, etc. Create a real-time updated data API for journalists to use in their stories. Whenever they need to include an accurate figure, they could make a call to this API, which would ensure the story’s figures remained up-to-date far into the future.
* Global archive search: Create a solution that pulls information from a range of media APIs, historical records, Wikipedia, and additional databases to present a range of information on a specific historical event or concept from a variety of angles. Give your solution an algorithm to prioritize the pieces of information that can be used most effectively by journalists in the news production process.
* History visualization: Create a solution that enables data visualizations to be developed for specific historical events whenever there is sufficient data to do so, pulling data from APIs or data scraping.
 
## Additional Considerations:

You could also tackle this challenge from the “Consumption” phase. If you take this approach, make note of it in your presentation.
