EXAMPLE #7: SMARTER HEADLINES
=============================

* Phase: Distribution
* Context: Personal

## Background:

With far more news stories to consume than there is time, the simple headline (the title of an article) still reigns supreme. A good headline gives a clue about the content it’s attached to, cuts through the noise around it, and encourages a media consumer to click through and spend their time consuming that particular piece of content instead of the hundreds of other possibilities available.

Because of their power and persuasiveness, headlines are a crucial means by which media is distributed and shared. Media organizations focused on social media as a distribution mechanism have invested extensive research into what makes a headline go “viral”: lists, numbers, witty or sensational statements, character and word limits for Twitter, etc. However, headlines also need to be crafted with integrity: bold headlines on content that doesn’t deliver what’s promised can be disappointing or misleading. How can we use data, technology, and analytics to suggest smart, tasteful headlines?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution that generates and/or suggests optimal headline possibilities for a piece of content based on information about that content and its audience. Rather than automatically generating headlines, think of ways to keep the journalist in control and to accept their editorial judgement and input.

## Use Cases:

* Machine Learning for Dynamic Headlines: Create a solution that uses analytics to track how often and by whom particular headlines are clicked, and suggests to journalists what words or phrases to include in their headlines for which specific target audiences, markets, and demographics based on past activity. Consider presenting several differently-worded headlines for the same piece of content to different users based on data you could get from browser cookies/history, analytics profiles, demographic information, etc.
* Headlines from Content Analysis: Using Natural Language Processing and text analysis, suggest what topics a piece of media content is mostly about, what information or keywords are relevant to the story, and what words a journalist would want to consider including in their article’s headline.
* Exploring Bias and First Impressions: Do specific headline wordings prime or “set up” a media consumer’s opinion? Create a solution (using sentiment analysis, perhaps) that explores how to create “neutral” headlines for sensitive topics that are still captivating enough to be clicked on.

## Additional Considerations:

* If your solution is automatically generating headlines or headline suggestions, they must conform to normal language grammar rules and not just be a “jumble of words”. Nobody will click on that!
* This challenge could also be approached from the “Situational” context. If you take this approach, make note of it in your presentation.
