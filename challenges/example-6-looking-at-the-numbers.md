EXAMPLE #6: LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS
==================================

* Phase: Production & Consumption
* Context: Situational

## Background:

Often, the news is about numbers: economic statistics, surveys about social trends, census data, business and finance transactions, sports scores, and government budgets. Quantitative data and statistics often contain rich stories waiting to be told, but such data can be technically complex to explain through spoken and written language alone.

As data floods our world, data visualization gives us power to more clearly convey the stories behind the numbers. However, in fast-paced, deadline-driven newsrooms, it’s not always an option to create a custom, bespoke interactive data visualization for every story that needs one.
 

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution that can be used to visualize many types of numerical data embedded within an article or other media content. You may choose to tackle this challenge from the “production phase”, with your intended users as journalists looking to put basic visualizations in their stories; or from the “consumption phase”, with your intended users as media consumers interested in gaining a better understanding of numerical information embedded in the content they consume. Whichever approach you take, make note of it in your final presentation.

## Use Cases:

* Domain-specific Data: In certain topics, the same types of data are often relevant over and over again. For example, many governments produce periodic economic and employment statistical reports that are repeatedly relevant to journalism stories about the economy. Publicly traded companies regularly release profit and earnings reports in standard formats to regulatory agencies. Sports statistics are common across teams and players in a league. Create a solution that can take in one of these commonly-released reports or datasets in the format published by a government or other authority, and create a repeatable, appropriate, domain-specific visualization that makes sense given the topic at hand.
* Teeny-tiny DataViz: Sometimes data visualizations don’t need to be large and interactive to add enhanced meaning to a numerical figure. Explore the use of sparklines and other micro-size data visualization techniques to embed small data visualizations of numbers interspersed right within the words, sentences, and paragraphs of a news article.
* Show All The Data: Regular, text-based articles often have numerical “data” in them anyway, but it’s not explicitly treated as such – they are simply part of the narrative the journalist wrote. These could be percentages, a price, a number of students in a classroom in an education story, parliamentary vote counts, etc. Can these isolated numbers in text articles be identified, automatically extracted and visualized to provide greater context?

## Additional Considerations:

* Production-phase Recommendation: Your solution should be a repeatable visualization tool that could be applied to many stories that come through a newsroom. Have your tool create a set of possible visualizations for any tabular dataset that has one independent and one dependent variable.
* Production-phase Recommendation: Assume journalists can feed your tool domain-specific datasets in a standard format every time they need to create a visualization.
