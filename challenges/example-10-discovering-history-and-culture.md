Phase: Distribution
Context: Cultural & Historical

## Background:

With broadcasters, newspapers, and media organizations around the world, media content has the power to bridge cultures. We so often browse our media based on sections like “Health and Science,” “Sports,” “News and Politics,” and “Entertainment.” What if we were to consider culture in how we group and distribute like stories? For example, a story about rural healthcare in Libya in current media platforms might be paired with other stories about healthcare or Libya. But what if such a story was situated with and could be browsed alongside other stories about rural life around the world?

How can we show people what their culture is interested in, compared to the interests of other cultures? Can the media website become a tool for reflection and self-awareness about our culture? Highlighting the cultural aspects of stories could be a way to sustain the interest of audiences, and to distribute common cultural threads across geographic areas.

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution to discover and distribute novel cultural and historical content. Focus the content discovery on something outside of the paradigm of traditional media “topics” like “Health and Science” or “Politics.” Instead, examine deeper cultural and historical relationships through lifestyle, conflict, values, and personal relationships. The point is to enable the distribution of related content and information in unique ways outside of existing recommendation systems that rely on traditional topics.

## Use Cases:

* What’s happening here, as reported over there: Sometimes news sources external to a culture can be more dispassionate and less biased, or at least differently biased than local sources. Create a solution that aggregates international news sources covering a country or area, but not of/from that country or area. For instance, if a user in Scotland wanted to hear about the Scottish Independence referendum, how might they use your solution to find the non-UK news sources reporting on it?
* Cultural Context of Conflicts: Create a solution intended for audiences on either side of a geopolitical conflict, to foster cultural understanding and better communication with “the other side.” How could media and journalism play a role in bringing warring countries closer together towards peace? Or showcase projects that are supporting a peace process or indicators of mutual understanding?
* What do they watch?: What proportions and kinds of news and media content do audiences in countries other than our own pay attention to? A user may know what “celebrity gossip” stories look like in the USA. What if a media distribution system could show a user what the celebrity gossip is like in Kenya? Even looking at cities within countries – what content is more or less featured depending on your culture or where you live?
* Crowdsourced content curation: New mobile media tools such as Flipboard or Pulse allow users to curate news content and present it in a new way by creating their own “magazines” of compiled news stories. What are new ways in which content could be curated, compiled and distributed according to a new cultural framing?
 
## Additional Considerations:

Come up with a means for your solution to automatically organize content by cultural aspects, rather than having a journalist identify each piece of content.
