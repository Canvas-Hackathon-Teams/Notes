Newsworld: Discover the world through the news!
====================================

Submitted by Alla Rybina.

## Phase:

This challenge fits into Consumption phase. It focuses on how individuals and audiences consume media. The challenge addresses how the audiences interact with and interpret journalism.

## Context:

This challenge is addressing the Situational Context and Historical Context. This challenge will combine media content and its georeferencing during the time. Media+Georgaphy+Time = new way of discovering the world through news consumption.

## Background:

Imagine that you are James Cook who explores the digital world by means of media. All you learn every day about different parts of the world – are the news coming from certain regions. Every day there are new spots on the map – news from the new regions. This newsmap will make explicitly clear, which regions are “popular” and which are “silent” or “rare”. So, every day – there is a new map, with new spots and through the history, you can track, which regions appeared on the map and when. It can also show you the concentration of attention to certain regions and give you as an explorer a new global outlook on our world and media. Feel yourself an explorer of the newsworld!

## Challenge Prompt:

Almost all the news companies have a geographical categorization. But, I want to see exactly the spots on the map that show what's going on in this or that area. I am interested in a newsmap, that is ‘alive’. It is like a map of weather forecasts, which shows the winds, cyclones and anticyclones. There can be a map that shows the newsflow, its intensity and concentration, different topics (may be marked by colours), or “new” spots on the newsmap. The map will reflect the most “news worthy” regions and the “forgotten” or ones. The map can also work as a search engine; it should show the news depending on the click of the user on the map.

> It would be interesting to read what’s new on the map or news from “rare” geographical areas.

## Use Cases:

We learn about the world from the news. We learn about new places, names on other languages, we learn how to pronounce the name of that volcano in Iceland or we learn how to pronounce words in Cyrillic of Arabic when certain regions become newsworthy. So, this newsmap will show us new regions of our world that exist only in the media world.

This will:

* show us how much we Don’t know about parts of the world that are not presented on this map

* give a chance to “unpopular” regions to become “news-popular”. The single spots from the “rare” news-regions can be easily found on such a map and paid much more attention from the public.

If we manage to gather historical data on certain places, we can see when this or that city/place/region popped up in the news for the last time. So, we can actually trace historically the newsworthiness of a certain region.

## Resources:

Basically it is a process of reorganization of the news that already exist on Al Jazeera news website. It’s a new way of systematization of the news, the newsmap – is going to be a new catalog that sorts and presents existing content in a new way. So, we don’t create new content we just give the existing one a new shape, angle and spice.
