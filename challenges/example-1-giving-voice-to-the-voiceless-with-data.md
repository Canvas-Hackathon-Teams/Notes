EXAMPLE #1: GIVING VOICE TO THE VOICELESS WITH DATA
===================================================

* Phase: Distribution
* Context: Editorial

## Background:

Editorial missions of media organizations are often inspiring and aspirational, but it can be tough to measure their success or impact. One of Al Jazeera’s guiding editorial principles in its news coverage is to “give voice to the voiceless.” The New York Times is famous for its tagline, “All the News That’s Fit to Print.” Other media organizations often have editorial missions that are similarly important to their journalistic operations.

The emerging fields of big data and data science can offer us tools, techniques, and possibilities for teasing out trends in vast amounts of information. How could big data analysis allow us to measure the editorial mission of a media organization?

For example, if we were considering Al Jazeera’s media content, how could we find out what Al Jazeera is giving “voice” to and identify what is being overlooked? How could news be distributed differently, or covered differently to adjust for it? Feel free to examine this challenge from a media organization or “mission” of your choosing like the New York Times, BBC, Deutsche Welle, or others.

## Challenge Prompt:

Using a media organization’s API or content database, analyze its content from a data science perspective. Where is the media organization meeting and exceeding its editorial goals and mission, and where is it falling short? On what groups, topics, areas, or events should it focus to ensure a balanced perspective in its coverage? How could it distribute content and coverage differently?

## Use Cases:

* Comparative analysis: Leila is a politics editor at a major TV broadcaster. A parliamentary election is coming up in Turkey, and she’s interested in knowing if her organization has been covering the five political parties running for seats in parliament in a balanced way in the six months preceding the election. She types in the five party names as search terms, and is able to see quantitative metrics about the number and time of TV broadcasts that have been aired on each party. She then wants to compare coverage on the two candidates polls indicate are most likely to win the Prime Ministership, and enters their names as search terms.
* Sentiment analysis: It’s not enough to cover particular controversial topics or people; for news to be balanced and objective it matters whether those topics are covered in a favorable or unfavorable light. Create an interface where content producers at a media organization could search for a term and see if recent coverage on that term is slanted positively or negatively using sentiment analysis.
* Geographic analysis: News happens all over the world. What geographic areas is Al Jazeera mentioning more often, and which might be passed over?
* Addressing Polarization and Fostering Constructive Debate: Media polarization is a difficult issue in many countries. News organizations sometimes adopt a particular editorial stance or political outlook to appeal to an audience base with similar worldviews. Unfortunately, this can result in hardened opinions, diminish opportunities for constructive debate and “changing minds”, and make it more difficult for societies split between multiple sides of an issue to “bridge the gaps” and achieve lasting compromise and progress. Create a solution that calls attention to trends and indicators of polarization in a particular media organization’s content, or a solution that helps media organizations track occasions and opportunities where content they publish is or could foster constructive debate. 

## Additional Considerations:

* The solution or its final output should be useable by a non-technical user, such as journalists or editors themselves.
* If applicable, the solution should allow for multiple search terms, as well as a broad overview visualization.
* You can also tackle this challenge from the “Production” phase. If you take that approach, make note of it in your presentation.
