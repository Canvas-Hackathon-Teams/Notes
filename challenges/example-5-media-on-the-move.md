EXAMPLE #5: MEDIA ON THE MOVE
=============================

* Phase: Distribution
* Context: Personal 

## Background:

Humanity is always on the move. There are over 1 billion motor vehicles in the world today, nearly 100,000 commercial airline flights daily, and all sorts of trips by public transport, bicycles, and our 14 billion feet.

Increasingly, our technology is moving along with us as well – and by extension, our media, news, and entertainment. One in every five people worldwide owns a smartphone; more if you include traditional mobile phones and digital tablets. Media consumers today take in information before, during, and after all of the trips they make. We may transition from watching television while we go about household chores, to scanning headlines on our smartphones commuting to work, to reading the news online on our office desktop computers.

How do we ensure content is reaching people in as many scenarios as possible? How does moving about the world change our ability to distribute and consume media? Does travel from Point A to Point B make certain types of content more or less relevant? How does consuming media and other “distractions” while in transit impact the safety of our journeys?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution to increase effective distribution of media by improving the experience of media consumers in motion. This could incorporate multiple devices like smartphones, tablets, wearable hardware, dashboard displays, and cars themselves, as well as more stationary technologies like laptops, desktop computers, billboards, and transit infrastructure. Your solution could be an entirely new way to distribute media, or an incremental improvement on challenges or problems present in the ways we already distribute and consume media in transit.

## Use Cases:

* Moving from Device to Device: Sometimes we don’t have enough time to finish and fully enjoy longer-form media before we need to be on the move again. Create a solution whereby the user could start consuming a news article or longer video segment on one device such as a smartphone (while on their commute), and then transfer where they are in the content to another device (such as a tablet or desktop computer). Also consider finding ways like QR codes to link other media to these devices, like broadcast television and printed newspapers.
* The Right Content at the Right Time and Place: If a user only has a few minutes to consume media as they wait for a city bus or are in between stops on a subway, they may not want a piece of long-form investigative journalism, but a shorter highlight piece. Create a solution that takes into account the time a user has available and the environment they’re travelling through to suggest and distribute appropriate content to them.
Motion Sickness: Many people find it difficult to consume content while in motion, especially written articles. Create a solution to limit motion sickness while consuming content?
* Active Transportation, Passive Media: Bicycling is a very common way to get around in many countries, but often requires greater alertness on behalf of the cyclist than other modes of transportation, especially if on the same road as cars and trucks. Headphones and taking one’s eyes off the road can be dangerous. Create a solution that distributes appropriate media to bicyclists so they can consume it in a safe way.
* Safety First: Even though we take these risks every day, times of transit can be dangerous. Pedestrians paying attention to smartphone screens and not the road they’re walking on run the risk of being hit by cars and vehicles – or even falling down stairs or street curbs they failed to see. Drivers often listen to the radio, but screens or other media that divert their attention from the road could cause traffic collisions. Wearing audio headphones while operating a vehicle, bicycling, or being a pedestrian cuts down on situational awareness. Create a solution that reminds commuters and travellers to be aware of their surroundings, minimizes the distraction potential of media, and/or reduces the potential for accidents and injuries.
 
## Additional Considerations:

* Consider having your solution incorporate or be compatible with multiple types of devices, especially wearables like Google Glass, Smart Watches, and others.
* Consider having your solution link old and new forms of media – like newspapers with smartphones, etc.
* Consider having your solution provide relevant information about a user’s journey or travel (traffic patterns, weather, schedules, time to destination, etc) as they are consuming media content.
* This challenge can also be tackled as a “consumption” phase challenge, or from the “Situational” context. If you take either approach, make note of it in your presentation.
