EXAMPLE #9: THINK OUTSIDE THE COMMENT BOX
=========================================

* Phase: Consumption
* Context: Editorial

## Background:

People don’t just consume media and then forget about it. We like to share our own opinions too! Whether it’s posting a link to our social networks with our own spin on things, or writing our thoughts in the ubiquitous comment box on news websites, today’s media is part of multiple engaging dialogues. The journalist has an editorial voice, but the audience does as well.

Unfortunately, “comment trolling” is all too common. Give people a free-form text box, and they’ll broadcast their wildest opinions. Some media outlets have experimented with in-line commenting, reaction buttons, and other forms of micro-responses, but more exploration can be done in this area.

How can we engage audiences while elevating the quality of discussion? Could we extract meaningful information from user responses that could be used to influence decisions about coverage in the newsroom? What about building audience communities around particular kinds of content?

## Challenge Prompt:

Create a solution for consumers to engage with media content that goes “beyond the comment box.” This could be aimed at advancing a particular media organization’s editorial agenda, giving audiences a greater understanding of themselves, or giving newsrooms a greater understanding of audiences. The point is to explore ways to make audience engagement useful and avoid degeneration into “comment trolling.”

## Use Cases:

* Quotes, Timestamps, and Annotations: Create a solution where consumers could insert their reactions and opinions contextually, right exactly at the point of a video or passage of a text article that gave them an emotional reaction micro-response, rather than at the end of the page like so many currently existing comment systems.
“I’m Feeeeeling…”: Instead of sections and topics like “Science,” “Sports,” “Entertainment,” what if we could browse news stories by feeling and emotion? Create a solution where users could rate or tag pieces of content with response emotions, and then the solution could use those ratings and tags to present the news according to how people are responding to it.
* Value tracker: Create a solution that surfaces the most valuable comments or references in a specific online comment system. Or, automatically provide markers to comments, separating them in a range of categories users could rate and tag, like “rants” or “insightful” or “conservative” or “liberal”.
 
## Additional Considerations:

To facilitate greater interaction, consider developing a solution where users don’t have to create an account or log in to post reactions.
Your solution should not involve the overused free-form text comment box. If it does, it should at least be incorporated in a novel way.
