EXAMPLE #2: WHAT’S IN THE PAPERS TODAY, HAL?
============================================

* Phase: Consumption
* Context: Personal

## Background:

Talking, chatting, gossiping, oral storytelling, conversation, “shooting the breeze” – the human voice has been the most crucial medium for sharing information for thousands of years. Conversations occur in many different contexts – between two neighbors, a large group of friends, or the conversation each of us has in our own heads. They ebb and flow from topic to topic depending on what’s going on around the participants, how they’re feeling, what they’re interested in, and what’s currently important.

Voice recognition and natural language processing technologies have come a long way in recent years. Computers, electronic devices, and software now have much of the power we do to communicate and interact via voice. How could voice, language, and conversational interfaces change the way we discover and consume media content?

## Challenge Prompt:

Use voice recognition and/or natural language processing tools and APIs to create a solution that allows users to consume and discover news through natural conversation.

## Use Cases:

Individual Conversations: Morad likes to check the headlines as he has his morning coffee. Andrew likes to incorporate advice from fashion critics as he decides his daily outfits. Build a solution that would let them discover and listen to the morning news or fashion and style column advice simply by talking and asking questions.
Group Conversations: Politicians and staff are working on an important new law, and while they’re having their conversations and debates, they’re interested in recent news articles pertinent to the topic they’re addressing. Build a solution with a voice interface where multiple people (in a conference room, say) could search and consume content and information on a particular topic.
 

## Additional Considerations:

* The solution should be able to understand the voices of many people.
* The solution should be able to accept voice commands or queries, and also vocalize output.
* Consider building your solution as a mobile device or an app that works with a smartphone.
