## THEME: CREATING SAFE SPACES AROUND THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF NEWS

### Phase:
Production

### Context:
Cultural and Historical

### Background:

All the apps in the world will not make a lot of difference if we do not support people to use it in the best ways. Many challenges need solutions that are nit necessarily technical, but societal and interpersonal.

News and the tech industry have a harassment problem. We find it in the comments, on social media, sometimes also in the newsroom itself. It also affects the way news is reported, presented, and funded - such as in #GamerGate, where multiple feminist games writers and commentators were harassed and forced to quit due to intense harassment and 'doxxing' (release of private information to the public without consent) by so-called "GamerGaters".

None of this is unique to the media, but by not prioritizing the creation of anti-oppressive policies and safe spaces, news companies are failing their staff and their readers. 

As things stand, few news companies take anti-oppressive practice seriously within their own operations, or are not equipped with the tools to adequately do so. Benign content is removed without consideration, such as the takedown of breastfeeding photos or the deletion of Facebook and Google Plus accounts with seemingly "unreal" names, while hateful, harassing content is allowed to remain in the guise of "humour". Sites such as Jezebel have reported a major need to fix problems with their commenting policy, only to be ignored by their parent company. Content moderators are often underpaid (if paid at all) and overworked, without adequate emotional or mental support, and are not adequately educated in anti-oppressive communication. Comments, content, advertising - all of these are affected by the lack of support around anti-harassment and anti-oppressive work.

What does anti-oppression look like in a newsroom and in an online community? What principles, tools, ideas, behaviors can encourage meaningful, safe interactions? How can moderators be properly trained and supported? And who are these moderators going to be? How do we instil these values in all levels of the newsroom, from representation in staff to representation of stories?

Is there one broad framework that can be developed which encompasses the social roles of journalists, commenters or moderators in a way that isn't overly-policied but also within an anti-oppresive framework? 

One option could be to choose a specific media organization’s output, and improve its internal and external interactions. Another could be to design a new platform/series of guidelines for interaction and engagement that a diverse selection of media companies can adopt, or to bulid a series of tools to encourage positive interactions, based on existing solutions created by marginalized/harassed groups and individuals. Yet another would be to come up with strategic best practices on actually effectively engaging news and media organisations to actually make privacy, safety, and anti-oppression a major priority - not just a side effect.

### Challenge Prompt: 

Consider the human side of technology: how do we support and organise people to support anti-oppressive web content and web community? What are the problems with existing structures of labor and engagement? What does a human-centered, anti-oppressive community platform look like? How can a community and a newsroom encourage interaction in a way that somehow mitigates the power imbalances inherent in publishing vs reading?

### Use Cases:

* Trolls often dominate, threaten, harass when certain topics are raised on social media or in news reports. How do we prevent that from happening, remove/deter the trolls, and create a safe space for respectful interaction?
* Commenting at the bottom of an article creates a strong power imbalance between the content and the comment. Some companies such as Quartz, Medium and SoundCloud have adopted in-line comments, while the New York Times’s experimental platform Quips provided  word-by-word commenting. How can we better create meaningful engagement while also making safe spaces?
* Newsrooms often claim to have positive, diverse cultures that encourage free thinking, but rarely create structures to enable meaningful, non-blame-filled interactions to take place (such as Jezebel's issues with the 'Rape GIF' and Gawker Media's inaction)
* The role of filtering the most toxic comments, like so much capitalist toxicity, has been outsourced to people in developing countries with little or no support to lessen the impact of their work. How can we better train and support moderators?  
* Is it possible to create a digital space that encourages participation, yet doesn’t exploit the labor of those users for financial gain?
