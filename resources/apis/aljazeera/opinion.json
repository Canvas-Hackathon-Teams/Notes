        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Americans are used to turning on the nightly news to see violence, unrest and angry protesters in some far away land. We like to pretend that those kinds of problems happen in \"other\" nations and that Americans would never feel so angry, trapped or disenfranchised that violence would seem like the only option for expression. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, after tonight's ruling by the St Louis County grand jury to not indict Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown, those images of violence, burning buildings and protests are again coming from the United States and not some \"other\" nation. And without some serious work on the broken and dysfunctional government in the US events like Ferguson will be more frequent in the future.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In the US there are three levels of government that overlap in the lives of most citizens, local government, state government and federal government. In most cases these levels of governance operate independently of each other, only interacting in the event of a crisis or a project too big to be handled by any one entity. A huge summer hurricane can't be handled by the state alone, so the federal government offers aid and assistance. The federal government seeks to fight Ebola, but needs local hospitals and cities to implement healthcare standards. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In other words, when these levels of government work together the nation moves smoothly, concerns and crises are mitigated, and citizens feel both respected and invested in their community. None of that happened in Ferguson, Missouri, which is why riots and social unrest have rocked the town and as a consequence the nation for months. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Conflict of interest</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>When Michael Brown was first shot, the response of the local government was so inept, so tone deaf and so over the top that the initial riots were all but guaranteed. Initially, the Ferguson police department allowed <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/why-was-michael-brown-s-body-left-there-for-hours/article_0b73ec58-c6a1-516e-882f-74d18a4246e0.html\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Brown's body to lie</a> in the middle of a residential neighbourhood uncovered, for hours, which both disturbed and enraged the local community. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>Rather than respond or engage the concerns of the mostly African American Third Ward of Ferguson, police showed up in riot gear, with machine guns and armoured tanks. This, in the absence of any explanation for the shooting, only perpetuated the idea that the government didn't serve the local community. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>To make matters worse, the mayor of Ferguson never required the local police to release a written police report to the public, despite that being standard practice, and the mayor spent more time on national television and radio programmes than he did talking to local activists who may have given some real insight into why Ferguson residents felt the way that they did. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Had the problems with government action begun and ended with local incompetence perhaps some of the tragedies in Ferguson could have been prevented. The state or perhaps federal government could have stepped in and corrected local mistakes. Unfortunately, poor oversight, lack of consistency, and gross negligence continued up the chain of government. The county prosecutor, Bob McCulloch, assigned to the Darren Wilson case had a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/gov-jay-nixon-wont-replace-controversial-prosecutor-michael-brown-case-265756\" target=\"_blank\">clear conflict of interest</a>; so despite the fact that getting an indictment is a fairly easy task many questioned if he would properly perform his duties. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Officer Wilson shot an unarmed teenager and there was conflicting eyewitness testimony, and under US law, an indictment is a jury simply saying there is enough ambiguity in a story that a trial is necessary to determine the truth. Given the clear conflict of interest and the stakes being an indictment not a verdict on innocence or guilt, Governor Nixon should have assigned another prosecutor to the case. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>However, he refused to do so, not only bringing the entire trial into question but symbolically telling the citizens of Ferguson concerned over the Brown shooting that their concerns were irrelevant. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Crisis of faith</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>Unfortunately, the problems don't stop with the governor, President Barack Obama can be held accountable for what happened in Ferguson after the grand jury decision as well. After seeing the overly aggressive behaviour of Ferguson police against protesters and the press back in August, the president suggested a review of the federal political militarisation of the police known as Program 1033. But the president did not follow up, and the review <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/white-house-police-demilitarization\" target=\"_blank\">died in the corridors of Washington</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>So is it any surprise that after the grand jury verdict, the local Ferguson police force was right back to shooting smoke bombs and tear gas, using armoured tanks and arbitrarily changing protest routes and restrictions, all but provoking a new conflict? </span></p>\r\n<p><span>On the ground in Ferguson I witnessed hundreds of protesters of all colours and ages marching through the streets of the town and in surrounding areas. The true tragedy was not that they were upset about the grand jury decision to not even indict Darren Wilson. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The vast majority of the men and women that I spoke to were not surprised by the grand jury decision, even if they disagreed with it. The real tragedy is that so few Americans, of all colours, believed that the local police, mayor, prosecutor, governor or president of the United States, were actually interested in or capable of delivering any sort of justice in the shooting of Michael Brown. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>There is a crisis of faith in the US government, from Washington to main street US. When a people lack faith, lack hope in the men and women they've elected to power to actually represent their interests, violence and open conflict are not far behind. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Unless there is a fundamental change in how Americans view their government, unless government accountability becomes more than an election year slogan or an excuse to cut programmes, government abuses like Ferguson will continue. And the Americans' distanced view of \"other\" nations' problems will come crashing through TV screens from far more cities than just Ferguson. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Dr Jason Johnson is a professor of political science at Hiram College.

Those in support of the talks would regard it as a victory arguing that the integrity of Iran's nuclear industry was not sold out. They would point to the fact that they managed to keep intact the right to tap into $700m per month in frozen assets during the coming seven months when negotiations would continue. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">They would also point out that there was clear determination in the US and European teams to reach an agreement by the deadline. There were non-stop shuttles, bilateral, trilateral and collective talks, political and scientific consultations, especially by the three main negotiators, Zarif, Kerry, and former EU policy chief, Catherine Ashton.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We are continuing to chip away in Vienna, P5+1 united,\" tweeted Kerry late Sunday night. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Obama revealed in his Sunday interview with ABC news <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-interview-transcript-president-obama-on-this-week/blogEntry?id=27114969&ref=http%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2F7axtmEksHC\" target=\"_blank\">what lies at the core of the failure</a> to achieve agreement. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Iran would love to see the sanctions end immediately, and then to still have some avenues that might not be completely closed, and we can't do that,\" he said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Deep distrust</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This illustrates a deep distrust in Iran's repeated statements that it has no intention of building a bomb.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Arrogant [countries] tried their best … but were not able to bring Iran to its knees,\" tweeted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday. \"They will not be able to do so.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Hardliners in Iran, angered at the failure to lift sanctions, make political capital of Obama's words.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>\"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13930903001390\" target=\"_blank\">Obama has created these problems</a>,\" said <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Mohsen Rezaee</span>, secretary of the powerful Expediency Council, referring to the US sanctions against Iran. \"He must now settle them himself.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span>\"You cannot count on the Great Satan,\" said another hardliner, the deputy chief of staff of the army, Massoud Jazaeri. \"The Great Satan promises but it does not deliver.\"</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><em>Keyhan</em> front-page headline referring to the US says: \"The chief negotiator was not to be trusted.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span>It complains that after one year of talks, and \"much waste of time\" sanctions were not lifted.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The failure to lift sanctions is seen to cause economic problems. Mohammad Reza Sabz-Alipoor, head of Iran's International Trade Centre said the break-up of talks means \"more uncertainty, more doubts and more nuclear-talks-fatigue, adversely affecting our economy\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In Iran, there are also worries about statements by US Republicans such as Senators John Mc Cain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte, three of the party's leading foreign policy voices, saying the \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0J81S820141124?irp\" target=\"_blank\">extension of talks should be coupled with extra sanctions</a>\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Required steps</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Many in Iran would argue that over the past few months the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly confirmed that Iran has followed the required steps and has <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/iran-cuts-uranium-gas-stockpile-under-interim-nuclear-142650885.html\" target=\"_blank\">reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium</a> so why should it be scrutinised so closely for what appears mainly to be a suspicion that it may plan to make a bomb when it has denied such accusations repeatedly? They would point to the fact that the US is silent about nuclear stockpiles in Israel and Pakistan despite the serious security threats emanating from both countries. Iran insists it has the right to develop nuclear energy under the terms of its international treaties. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Obama admitted in his interview that there's going to be \"a long path towards normalisation of our relationship with Iran\". It seems as though the lack of mutual trust between Iran and the US may take longer to heal. The hope is that at the Vienna talks the first steps towards that long path were taken and that as promised by Kerry, negotiations over the next seven months would bear a specific goal of reaching that political agreement. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We have seen new ideas surface,\" said Kerry in his final statement to the press in Vienna. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We are not going to use all the seven months,\" said Foreign Minister Zarif. \"We'd like to reach a political agreement as soon as possible.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In a joint statement, EU envoy Catherine Ashton and Zarif also spoke of those \"new ideas\" that need to be explored. Those new ideas and the resolve to continue to work intensively on a new narrative both in Iran and in the West over improving mutual trust would perhaps be the only hope for a real political agreement in seven months. Otherwise another chance would be passed over to those threatening words that \"all options are on the table\".</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Dr Massoumeh Torfeh is former director of strategic communication at the UN Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) and is currently a research associate at the London School of Economics and Political Science, specialising in Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

On November 15, at a <span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/11/turkey-historical-revisionism-ataturk-erdogan.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">conference with Latin American politicians and scholars</span></a></span>, Erdogan claimed that \"Muslim seafarers\" had discovered the Americas three centuries before Italian explorer Christopher Columbus had done.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">He added: \"Columbus recalls seeing a mosque at the top of a hill [on] the shores of Cuba in his memoirs… A mosque will be fitting for that hill today. All we need is permission. Islam had developed and spread on the continent even before Columbus arrived.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Erdogan has always enjoyed challenging common narratives. In doing so, he appeals to Muslim public opinion both domestically and internationally. Despite recent setbacks, he still believes that he represents the Muslim world. In Turkey, his remarks were widely discussed in the pro-Erdogan media where some overzealous journalists even tried to substantiate his claims. <em>Aksam</em> newspaper, for instance, went further by detailing \"evidence\" of the presence of Islam in the Americas well before Columbus. As for the average man on the street, he certainly relished the idea of a Muslim at the forefront of American history - as revised by Erdogan.    </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Stands by his claim</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A few days later, following a flood of sarcastic commentaries in media outlets across the globe, Erdogan - rather than retract, spin or clarify his bizarre assertion - insisted he was right.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"<span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://t24.com.tr/haber/cumhurbaskani-erdogan-ankarada-konusuyor,277467\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">I told them that Muslims discovered the American continent 300 years before Columbus</span></a></span>. This is no new assumption; it was mentioned in the books of [Turkish] professor Fuat Sezgin who lives in Germany, as well as in other academic works. As for the proofs, several scientists have already produced them. And something interesting happened: Before the foreigners, our own youngsters have started to challenge this fact. Even grownups: We have columnists writing, cartoonists drawing against [this assertion]. Why? Because they don't believe a Muslim can achieve such a deed… This is lack of self-confidence,\" he told journalists, adding that he instructed the Ministry of Education to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-vows-to-teach-turkish-children-muslim-discovery-of-americas.aspx?pageID=238&nID=74485&NewsCatID=338\" target=\"_blank\">revise history textbooks accordingly</a>.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> And with these words, Erdogan defied the critics and satirists, and stood by his assertion that the Americas were discovered by Muslims in the 12th century.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What a conversion for a politician who, in 2005, was the initiator, together with then Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, of the so-called Alliance of Civilisations as an interfaith initiative to counter Samuel Huntington's theory on the \"Clash of Civilisations\" in the post-September 11 era. At the time, relations between Muslims and Christians - as well as Jews - were tense. Erdogan was the thriving prime minister of a Turkey that was touted as the model of nascent \"Muslim democracy\". He was negotiating with the European Union for full membership. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What country other than Turkey could have been the architect of such an initiative? The project was later adopted by the United Nations as a UN initiative called the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC). Within this framework, Erdogan and Zapatero co-sponsored several meetings around the world putting the emphasis on a common understanding between Islam and other religions on both humanitarian and social matters. Intercultural dialogue was the catchphrase of the hour.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Muslim proselytiser</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Let's fast forward to today: Erdogan is now president, but he appears to act more like a Muslim proselytiser, proposing to build mosques wherever he goes, boasting about achievements by Muslims in our day and in the past and adopting a style with patent religious undertones. As he puts it, he has become <span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/en/content/first-latin-american-countries-muslim-leaders-summit-ends/22358\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">a kind of \"missionary\" of the Muslim world</span></a></span>, constantly instilling confidence, but often at the expense of the facts and of the other faiths: \"Our duty is to inform about the Almighty until our last dying breath and invite people to the path of Allah.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This shift in Erdogan's policy (and behaviour) has already been noticed by the successors of Zapatero, who left power in 2011, a date which also corresponds to the beginning of Erdogan's openly authoritarian way of ruling domestically. The successor government in Spain has put on hold its participation in the <span>UNAOC</span>, while the project continues under UN auspices but with less and less impact, especially given the recent chaos and bloodshed in the Middle East.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With Erdogan's recent shenanigans, international public opinion received a confirmation of this shift as extensively reported by Spanish media along with other media outlets in Europe and the Americas. It is highly significant that a respected Spanish newspaper like <span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/11/15/actualidad/1416076557_740094.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><em>El Pais</em> has bluntly challenged his views</span></a></span> by writing that Erdogan was a leader cut off from reality and recalling his recommendations to the Finnish Prime Minister <span lang=\"TR\">Jyrki Katainen </span>during a visit there on the <span lang=\"TR\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/11/15/actualidad/1416076557_740094.html\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">need for Finnish families to have at least three children</span></a></span> as he recommends the Turks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The <em>Washington Post</em> also challenges Erdogan's interpretation of history: \"Most scholars insist the 'mosque' mentioned was a metaphorical allusion to a striking land feature. There have been no archaeological discoveries of Islamic structures pre-dating Columbus' arrival in the New World.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Rewriting history according to one's own religious beliefs, no matter the new narrative, is a highly controversial and perilous enterprise, particularly when the very politician is already under suspicion for his sectarian policies at home and abroad. Erdogan would have done better to recall the anti-Islamic zeal of Spanish conquerors of America when they considered the indigenous people on par with the Moors that they chased out during the Reconquista in Spain. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Cengiz Aktar is Senior Scholar at Istanbul Policy Center.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Galileo Galilei upheld the theory of Copernicus that the Earth moves around the sun. The Church opposed him but he ignored it. When he published \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" in 1632, the Inquisition tried him. He was forced to give up his belief in the Copernican theory, forbidden from writing and publishing, and sentenced to an indefinite prison term. Still, he was lucky to escape the tragic end of Giordano Bruno. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In \"On the Infinite Universe and Worlds\", Bruno argued that the universe was infinite and that it contained an infinite number of worlds in 1584. He was arrested by the Inquisition and tried. He was kept imprisoned and interrogated periodically. In the end, he was declared a heretic and burned at the stake since he refused to recant.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">I know that Bruno was not a great scientist and full of contradictions. He asserted the universe's infinity with hardly any reliable evidence. But there is one favourable thing about Bruno which makes me like him the most: He resisted the authority. He figured out that the stars are distant suns not scientifically but with intuition, but also he sacrificed his life for it. He was like a science knight as he resisted the common belief imposed by the Church which was not only the political authority then but also dominated ordinary people's lives.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Precious refusal</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Turkish President Recep Tayyip <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/erdogan-says-muslims-discovered-americas-20141115181222841516.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Erdogan's recent words at a summit of Muslim leaders</a> from Latin America generated an altercation full of derision. That has made me think how hard it must have been to stand up and put an argument against the authority and how precious Bruno's refusal was.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To be frank, I didn't understand why Erdogan's words drew such a rebuff at the beginning. The summit in question gathered Latin American <em>Muslim</em> leaders. The context of his argument was appropriate as the attendants were Muslims from the Americas. Erdogan has always been the person who connects history to present-day politics. He talks about ties between Africa and Islam when he visits Africa or the common history of the Turks and Asia when he meets his Asian counterparts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When I took a closer look at the controversy spurred by Erdogan's speech, I realised that his words were distorted by the headlines. He didn't actually say that Muslims discovered America. He said: \"Muslim sailors reached the American continent 314 years before Columbus, in 1178. In his memoirs, Christopher Columbus mentions the existence of a mosque atop a hill on the coast of Cuba.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As such, Erdogan merely made a mention of Muslims' arriving to the Americas before Columbus and he didn't claim it as a discovery. He also referred to Columbus' writings and didn't make something up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The discovery of the Americas has always been a controversial issue and Columbus' claims in his memoirs have been questioned before. For hundreds of years, it was accepted that Columbus discovered the Americas but <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.psmag.com/navigation/books-and-culture/fail-christopher-columbus-america-discovery-bahamas-holiday-68247/\" target=\"_blank\">this theory is no longer reliable</a>. For example, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/s-frederick-starr/so-who-did-discover-america\" target=\"_blank\">Islamic scholar Abu Raihan al-Biruni</a> may have discovered the American continent long before Columbus, according to S Frederick Starr. Or Fuat Sezgin, a Turkish professor emeritus on Arabic-Islamic science, has stated for a long time that, it was <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.laits.utexas.edu/gma/mappamundi/docs/precolumbamerica.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">discovered by Muslim seafarers</a>. There are many other claims that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://lostislamichistory.com/columbus-was-not-the-first-to-cross-the-atlantic/\" target=\"_blank\">Muslims were the first to cross the Atlantic</a> but that's not the issue any more as Erdogan's words have been distorted, decontextualised and used to discredit him.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Greatest absurdity</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As Winston Churchill once said, \"History is written by the victors.\" Nevertheless, the most nonsensical side of the discussion on Erdogan's remarks is the critics accepting a controversial topic as fact and accusing him of <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/11/turkey-muslim-conquest-america-columbus-erdogan.html\" target=\"_blank\">attempting to rewrite history</a>. Yet the greatest absurdity is to use mockery on social media as evidence of Erdogan's being unscientific. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Western sources shouldn't be believed as if they are sacred texts,\" Erdogan recently said, without taking a step back. Going further, he promised to maintain his encouraging role in this regard. In Turkey, it is known that he is good at trending topics and is a talented politician in driving the common agenda.

So he was born to die</a>,\" goes Bob Dylan's song, The Death of Emmett Till. The lyrics are as timely today as when they were first written and performed because \"black skin\" remains a threat and the cause of death of far too many in the United States and the world. The song relates the story of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black youngster from Chicago, who was murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi on August 28, 1955, by two white men because, supposedly, he flirted with a white woman. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Mamie, Emmett's mother, insisted on a public funeral in Chicago with an open casket for everyone to view the brutality of racism that completely disfigured and mutilated the face of her beautiful boy. The motionless body was Emmett's but the open casket is America's well-documented lynching history, racism, total otherisation and sub-humanness of African Americans. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">America's soul continues to be burdened by the countless motionless African American bodies that pile up daily in inner city streets, alleyways and police shoot-outs. Not to leave behind the walking living bodies made motionless and numbed into a lifeless existence through racism: filling prisons, shattering dreams and creating permanent modern \"civilised\" slavery. <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Black life is expendable?</span></span></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Michael Brown verdict is yet another reminder, if any was still needed, that racism was and always will be America's open casket through which African American suffering and sub-humanness is on constant display. Once again, the nation and the world are numbed at the no-guilty verdict and the closing of America's moral casket on the hopes, dreams and aspirations of Michael Brown, a young African American whose body was riddled with America's bullets of racism and indifference to Black suffering.   </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">How to be shocked when we are sick and tired of being shocked, as the deaths of blacks is the daily norm and normalised in the nation's consciousness? Not guilty has been etched with knives and millions of racism's bullet holes into the nation's collective non-being ascription to African Americans. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This is further ensconced with our differentiated just-us legal system coloured by race and white supremacy. A black life is expendable, worthless and guilty for being visibly black; a mere biological material, a divine error and permanent sub-humanness. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Guilty for walking while black, guilty for being black, guilty for daring to speak, sing and dance while black, and guilty for having the audacity to want to be black. Walking, driving, working, and living as black are a dangerous and life-threatening endeavour in today's America and indeed it has always been the case for \"People of Colour\" since Christopher Columbus landed on these shores.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">America's open casket to the world is its racism that has been institutionalised and commodified into every part of the society from the police force, political order, court system, corporate structure, media and global relations. Some are quick to point to gains made by African Americans since the civil rights movement; and, indeed we can point to these noticeable advancements including the first black president in the White House. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, statistical data provides a different picture of a nation that is separate and profoundly unequal. African American unemployment and underemployment is almost twice as that of whites. Further, data shows that \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~angelh/Website/Studies/Article%208%20(Rev%20of%20Blk%20Pol%20Econ%20'10).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">by age 17, the average black student</a> is four years behind the average white student; black 12th graders score lower than white 8th graders in reading, math, US history and geography\". </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Disturbing facts</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What is most disturbing is that incarceration rates for black American men stands at 4,347 per 100,000 which is almost 6.5 times the national average of 707 per 100,000. Often US politicians and media talking heads spend countless hours speaking on prison-related human rights abuses abroad while under their noses a prison industrial complex is humming efficiently and their 401K might be invested in parts of it and providing a healthy return. More critically, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/african-americans/\" target=\"_blank\">African American household net worth stands</a> at $4,995 compared to $97,000 for whites, which is slightly ahead of an adult living under occupation in Palestine, and a poverty rate of 27.4 percent twice the national average.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In The National Center for Victims of Crime study, a troubling picture for African American young males and crime emerges concluding that \"black youth are three times more likely to be victims of reported child abuse or neglect, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/other-projects/youth-initiative/interventions-for-black-children's-exposure-to-violence/black-children-exposed-to-violence\" target=\"_blank\">three times more likely to be victims of robbery</a>, and five times more likely to be victims of homicide. In fact, homicide is the leading cause of death among African American youth ages 15 to 24\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> While the data shows blacks are victims of crime nevertheless, the approach by the government to their community adds insult to injury by treating them collectively as a criminal class by deploying police force to control rather than to serve and provide protection for the trans-historically abused community. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Racism is America's open casket to the world and the murder of Michael Brown is the latest episode in a too familiar story dating back to the founding of the country. Emmett Till's casket remains open today for the underlying causes that murdered him are still around and unchanged. Michael Brown's cause of death is America's racism, the police officer was the weapon and the grand jury is the clean up crew. Justice for African Americans remains an illusion since America fails to account for racism, the scars and the real bullets it leaves behind.   </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Hatem Bazian is coeditor and founder of the Islamophobia Studies Journal and director of the Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project, and a senior lecturer in the Departments of Near Eastern and Ethnic Studies at Berkeley University.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

Its discriminatory character, turning a large Arab Israeli minority into second-class citizens and delisting Arabic as an official language, will only confirm the ongoing discrimination that members of this group have been subjected to well before the drafting of the new law.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The fallout from this piece of legislation is likely to be purely symbolic, marking a shift in the Israeli ideology hailed by some right-wing elements of the Netanyahu government as a return to the basics of Zionism.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The schizophrenic self-presentation of the State of Israel as Jewish and democratic is coming to an end in a clear choice of the polity's Jewish and non-democratic fibre. But exactly what does a \"Jewish nation-state\" mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The ideologues of the regime are quick to point out that there is no inherent tension between France being a French and democratic state, or Germany being a German and democratic country. But neither Frenchness nor Germanness is equivalent to Jewishness. Even if the majority of citizens in France and Germany are Christian, these states are not declared to be \"Christian nation-states\".</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Definition of Jewishness</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">So what if Jewishness were not identical to Judaism, that is to say, to the Jewish religion? In fact, the official discourse in Israel has been, for a long time and purposefully, blurring the distinctions between religion, nationality, and ethnicity.</span></p>\r\n<p>The very definition of Jewishness according to the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfa-archive/1950-1959/pages/law%20of%20return%205710-1950.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">1950 Law of Return</a> is ambiguous, seeing that the two possible criteria are: having a Jewish mother or converting to Judaism. The first criterion is biological, while the second is religious.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Amendment 2, passed in 1970, accentuates the religious component, bestowing the right of immigration on \"a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew, except for a person who has been a Jew and has voluntarily changed his religion\". In other words, it is not enough to have been born of a Jewish woman in order to be considered a Jew; the act of conversion from Judaism to another faith would be grounds for excluding the convert from this definition. One wonders what happens under the Law of Return to the self-professed atheists born of Jewish mothers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">It is apparent that non-Jewish citizens of a Jewish state will find themselves in a limbo, regardless of the vacuous guarantees of \"equal personal rights\" under the law awaiting approval. But, as I have mentioned above, their predicament has been dire well before the drafting of this bill. The question, then, is why is the Israeli government dropping the pretence of its ability to balance the state's Jewish and democratic nature now, at this precise moment?</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Beyond the politicking considerations of a coalition dominated by right-wing hardliners, there are at least two possible explanations for the timing of the proposed piece of legislation.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Major stumbling blocks</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">First, it attempts to codify a narrative that equates the land occupied by the State of Israel with the \"historic homeland of the Jewish people\". With these words enshrined in the law, yet another obstacle will arise on the path to peace with the Palestinian people, who will be not only materially and symbolically, but also legally dispossessed of their land and their history.</span></p>\r\n<p>The words I have cited from the draft legislation usurp the historic origin as the exclusive property of one group of citizens and turn a deaf ear to the rightful claims of another group. Moreover, they render the Jewish attachment to a distant past more important than the ongoing presence of non-Jewish inhabitants in the same territory. All these are major stumbling blocks in the peace process, which will be guaranteed to stay fruitless if future Israeli governments are bound by the \"Jewish nation-state\" law. For instance, in accordance with it, the right of return for Palestinian refugees will be outright denied on the grounds that the territory claimed by Israel was not <em>their</em> historic homeland.</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Second, and more cynically: Could it be that the current rulers of Israel have made a calculated, conscious choice to weaken their emphasis on democracy? Although, in order to gain admission into the international community, it is still necessary to present one's state as democratic, the time of this requirement's non-negotiability might be coming to an end. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Widespread passive acceptance of technocracy and the dictates of the \"Troika\" in the European Union are the telltale signs of a gradual departure from democratic rhetoric and political practice. It would not be surprising that the Israeli right-wing politicians are ahead of the curve in an avowed abandonment of democratic discourse, and that the draft bill is but a symptom of this lamentable development.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-US\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.michaelmarder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Marder</a> is IKERBASQUE Research Professor at the University of the Basque Country, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Last week in London, Nobel Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and actress Angelina Jolie announced an ambitious global campaign to end the plight of 10 million stateless people - those who are without a country to call home. As the United Nations' refugee agency head Antonio Guterres recently noted: \"Statelessness makes people feel like their very existence is a crime.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ironically, on the very same day, the Dominican Republic reaffirmed its decision to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/4/stateless-in-thedominicanrepublicresidentsstrippedofcitizenship.html\" target=\"_blank\">disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of its own citizens</a>. This effort did not merely do away with classic birthright citizenship moving forward: This overzealous xenophobic effort stripped birthright citizenship for all those born in the country since the 1920s. Sadly, this event by our Caribbean neighbour went unnoticed in the United States.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Though a country's effort to create a stateless group is universally condemned, rogue countries have sadly used such a tactic to harm its most vulnerable minority groups. Such a status leaves these former citizens without the most basic of rights you and I take for granted. In other words, they exist as the most invisible and deprived people on the planet. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ending statelessness</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The global effort to end statelessness is widely applauded, especially by western democracies. Yet, it has <span>just</span> occurred to our southern border, and the leader of the free world has thus far remained silent. Specifically, on September 23, 2013, the Dominican Republic's Constitutional Court stripped the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of its residents in violation of that country's own constitution. This outrageous ruling occurred despite the fact that the very language of the governing constitution specifically recognises those individuals as citizens.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In response, on October 9, 2013, the Centre for Analysis and Research in Human Rights commenced a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), where the Dominican Republic is a member state. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Perhaps knowing that it did not have any legitimate defences, on November 4, the Constitutional Court, despite no longer having any related cases before it, on its own motion and without any parties formally calling for any decision related to the matter, wrote an unfounded advisory opinion that could only be viewed as a mockery of justice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The court ruled that despite the Dominican Republic's signing onto the IACHR treaty and being under the jurisdiction of the IACHR since the 1970s, the country was not bound by any determination of the IACHR. The world community immediately condemned this act.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, the matter makes hardly a headline in the US.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">If we believe that human rights matter, if international laws mean anything at all, we must condemn this abuse of basic human rights. This travesty at our doorstep simply cannot be tolerated. We must not allow history to repeat itself. Indeed, the actions in the Dominican Republic should remind us of the most horrific events in world history. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Citizenship deprivation</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Before the atrocities associated with the Holocaust happened, the Third Reich's Law on the Revocation of Naturalisations and the Deprivation of German Citizenship (July 14, 1933) deprived German Jews of their German citizenship. The law directed the collection and publication of the names of Jews, the names were listed in the Reich Law Gazette (\"Reichsgesetzblatt\"), and with the publication of the particular Reichsgesetzblatt, Jews lost their German citizenship. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Tragically, after the Dominican high court's decision, Dominican agencies were similarly directed to collect the names of Dominicans of Haitian lineage. While it is hopefully unlikely that the genocide of past generations will be repeated, the fact remains that hundreds of thousands of Dominicans are stateless, without any rights, and are subject to persecution that has already commenced. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In a similar set of circumstances, the world community has recently condemned Myanmar's persecution of their Rohingya Muslim minority. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Much like what is happening just to our south, a 1982 law revoked the citizenship of the Rohingya, which has led to atrocities that the United Nations and numerous other human rights organisations have condemned. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Much like what we are sure to hear from the Dominican Republic, after stripping people of citizenship, both the Third Reich and Myanmar characterised their persecuted people as mere illegal immigrants worthy of no rights. We may expect to hear similar justifications by the Dominican Republic. Such distortions are simply perverse and without basis in reality, or law for that matter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Decency and morals should cause us to rise up and insist that our government and our business interests act to end this atrocity, which otherwise may end with hundreds of thousands of refugees rushing to our shores and others throughout the hemisphere. Are we to wait until untold lives are destroyed and thousands die in the meantime? I hope not.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ediberto Roman is a law professor at Florida International University.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Israeli newspaper Haaretz recently reported on an internal European Union draft document proposing sanctions against Israel if its government continues to act in ways that render a two-state solution impossible. The revelations were quickly and widely disseminated on social media, and touted as a sign that the EU had had enough of Israel's intransigence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">However, those hopes were swiftly dashed by the bloc's new foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who last week <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-mideast-israel-eu-idUSKCN0J123K20141117\" target=\"_blank\">denied that there were plans to sanction Israel</a>. A discussion among EU foreign ministers was more about \"how to start a positive process with the Israelis and Palestinians to relaunch a peace process\", she said. \"It was not at all a question of isolating or sanctioning anybody.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is an intriguing affair, given that Haaretz is a respected newspaper whose articles on the issue seem to be well researched, sourced and verified. Indeed, Mogherini's denial came on the same day that Haaretz <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.626946\" target=\"_blank\">published the EU document</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is deeply disappointing that sanctions may not even be considered. Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which forms the legal basis of their relations, states that those relations \"shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles\". When it comes to the Palestinians, Israel is in blatant violation of this article.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Obstructive and destructive</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Worse still is Mogherini's public denial that sanctions are an option. The message this sends to Israel's government is that</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> it has carte blanche to continue its obstructive and destructive policies unimpeded. In the current climate of a radicalised Israeli polity and society, as well as tensions and unrest not seen since the last Palestinian uprising, this is extremely irresponsible and dangerous.</span></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Israel's actions in the week since Mogherini's denial already display a total disregard for EU concerns. Two days after the bloc's </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">foreign ministers condemned plans for new settlement-building, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/19/us-mideast-israel-settlement-idUSKCN0J31I920141119\" target=\"_blank\">Israel announced more illegal colonisation</a> of occupied territory (in addition to the thousands of settlement homes recently announced). </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/21/us-mideast-palestinians-israel-demolitio-idUSKCN0J50ZC20141121\" target=\"_blank\">Israel also rejected an appeal by the EU'</a>s five biggest members - Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and Spain - not to demolish more Palestinian homes, a practise that Human Rights Watch said on Friday \"amounts to collective punishment, a war crime\". Why would Israel listen to the EU or its member states when it knows there will be no punitive measures?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The EU is choosing to squander the decisive leverage it could have over Israel as the latter's largest trading partner. This only adds to Israel's sense of impunity, which is also nurtured by vast and unquestioning US support, including US veto power that renders the UN Security Council paralysed and irrelevant regarding the Israeli-Arab conflict.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Mogherini's statement will undermine the significance of ongoing legislatives votes in various EU member states to recognise Palestine. It will also vindicate those who think such steps are purely symbolic, and will lessen pressure on governments to reflect the will of their own parliaments. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">EU inaction would also go against public sentiment in Europe, where opinion polls have consistently shown that those who sympathise with the Palestinians far outnumber those who support Israel, even in countries whose governments have close ties with the latter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">BBC World Service </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">polls</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> of international views on Israel over the last three years show that among EU member states, the highest percentage of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4830948/BBC_Israel_polls_2012-2013-2014.png\" target=\"_blank\">positive sentiment was only 21 percent</a> (in France), and was as low as 4 percent (in Spain in 2013). Positive sentiment was also in single digits in Germany last year (8 percent). As such, EU inaction over Israel's treatment of the Palestinians is woefully out of step with public opinion and that of elected MPs.</span></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">More bark than bite</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Even without Mogherini's denial, a number of the sanctions reportedly floated are not particularly strong. According to Haaretz, they </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">include</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> \"</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">coordinated condemnations of the settlements; joint protests to the foreign ministry and prime minister's office; and more sharply worded communiques on the Israeli-Palestinian issue after the European Union's monthly foreign ministers' meetings\". In other words, the EU may stop saying please.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"There is also a proposal to reconsider the European Union's commitment not to participate in debates at the UN Human Rights Council under Clause 7, which relates specifically to the state of human rights in the West Bank,\" Haaretz reported. However, it is unclear how EU participation would make a difference when Israel has consistently ignored the council's resolutions since its creation in 2006.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Other sanctions reportedly include \"marking products manufactured in the settlements in EU supermarkets\" (not prohibiting their sale), \"limiting cooperation with Israel in various areas\" (not stopping it), and \"restrictions on the free-trade agreement with Israel\" (not reconsidering the agreement itself). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">None of this sounds like it would give Israel cause for serious concern. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"Labelling settlement products, implementing the EU-Israel trade agreement properly, and distinguishing between the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel are not really sanctions in my opinion,\" an expert on international law regarding the Israeli-Arab conflict, who has written extensively on EU relations with Israel, told me.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This whole affair makes the EU look supine, but it is not cause for Israeli celebration. The tide of European public opinion continues to turn against Israel - this cannot be indefinitely ignored or defied. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Furthermore, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel continues to make significant gains in Europe regardless of individual governments' stances. EU inaction is likely to further bolster BDS if it is seen as the only effective avenue for European rejection of Israeli policies.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Sharif Nashashibi is an award-winning journalist and analyst on Arab affairs.

That ISIL killed a Muslim convert is not extraordinary, but rather part of a routine practise of beheading Muslims that has emerged over the last decade.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Second, Kassig's death fits into an ongoing media narrative which explains ISIL's televised beheadings, usually carried out by European Muslims, as a means to attract new recruits, particularly from the West. Televised beheadings, which have been explained away as a means of intimidation of enemies and a marketing tool to gather new recruits, has a much more complex history and rationale.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Routinised campaign</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Beheadings in the name of Islam conducted by non-state actors can be <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/05/news/mn-65169\" target=\"_blank\">traced to the war in <span class=\"InternalLink\">Chechnya</span></a>, with the decapitations of captured Russian soldiers. The beheading of the kidnapped <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/23/us-pakistan-alqaeda-pearl-idUSTRE74M27020110523\" target=\"_blank\">journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002</a>, was ordered by al-Qaeda. However, the first systematic, routinised campaign of beheadings of both Muslims and non-Muslims began after the 2003 Iraq war, by a group that was initially separate from al-Qaeda. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Jordanian, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was the founder of the group during the Iraqi insurgency that would evolve into ISIL, and their most notorious beheading was of the American Nick Berg in 2004, dressing him in an orange jump suit to mimic the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. His death occurred however, within a broader campaign whose victims were primarily Muslims, whether it was captured Iraqi soldiers or Turkish truck drivers in Iraq, such as Ramazan Elbu. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Once Zarqawi's group decided to merge with al-Qaeda, becoming al-Qaeda in Iraq, al-Qaeda's central leadership pressured Zarqawi to end the beheadings, which often targeted Muslims, and refocus their attention on attacking US forces, representing the first tension between the two groups before their formal break in 2013. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">During these years, Zarqawi's group did not have the pretensions of statehood. It was a non-state actor that used beheadings as a way of forcing nations deploying troops to Iraq, such as the Philippines, to withdraw; prevent private companies from investing in Iraq's reconstruction; and intimidate Iraqis from joining the armed forces. To achieve the last two goals it primarily targeted Muslims participating in these endeavours. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Progenitor of ISIL beheadings</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL still uses beheadings, but for different aims. When the progenitor of ISIL conducted beheadings after the Iraq War, it was ostensibly to force foreign armies off Iraqi soil. By 2014, not only had all foreign armies left Iraq, but ISIL controlled a large swath of territory. Beheadings in 2014 of captured US and British hostages served as a means of a weak state, the \"Islamic State\", to retaliate against the US and UK air campaign against ISIL.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL is aware that western media outlets will not show the actual video of the moment of beheading, nevertheless the act of beheading does generate a storm of debate in the media. The gruesome method of beheading, as opposed to the firing squads they used to kill a large number of captured Iraqi soldiers, allows ISIL to cause revulsion among political leaders. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With an act of a sword, they manage to force both Obama and Cameron to react. The two men, who control the world's most advanced militaries, find themselves at the mercy of the sword. Both displayed physical pain and grief when they condemned the way their nationals died. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">One media narrative examines <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/beheadings-as-terror-marketing/381049/\" target=\"_blank\">beheadings as \"Terror Marketing\"</a>, suggesting that ISIL's rationale behind these videos is to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://wwlp.com/2014/09/04/isis-hopes-to-gain-support-with-its-beheading-videos/\" target=\"_blank\">attract new recruits</a>. An example of the \"terror marketing\" rationale can be found in the following statement by Paul Cruickshank, a terrorism analyst for CNN: \"Some of these men almost have a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/beheadings-as-terror-marketing/381049/\" target=\"_blank\">pornographic attraction to these violent scenes</a>, these violent beheading videos. It really sort of energises them.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Since the beheading campaign began in 2004 in Iraq, there have been a host of \"snuff\" websites, such as Ogrish.com and Liveleak, which upload beheading videos, demonstrating that \"pornographic attraction\" exists in the general public, though there has not been a wave of Ogrish or Liveleak viewers joining ISIL. One cannot possibly know if these videos \"energise\" an ISIL recruit as Cruickshank suggests. Most likely a beheading video will have little effect on the alienation a potential ISIL recruit perceives in his or her home society and is most likely energised by ISIL's actual success in establishing the \"Islamic State\", rather than these videos. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Furthermore, does ISIL's leadership even see these videos as a valuable recruiting tool? Mexican <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/06/22/96335_mexican-cartel-deals-drugs-violence.html?rh=1\" target=\"_blank\">drug cartels also conduct beheadings</a> in areas they control. For both organisations, beheadings serve as a means of maintaining domestic hegemony. It forces the population under their control to cower in fear and never challenge the power of the cartel, one of which happens to survive by charging for drugs, while the other charges for oil. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Vengeance justice</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On another level, ISIL contends to have formed an \"Islamic State\", and beheadings serve the same purpose as capital punishment in any state. They communicate both vengeance justice to its citizens, and at the same time instil fear into those citizens, which even include the most diehard ISIL foot soldier. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Beheadings are ISIL's public executions, just as the guillotine, hanging, or lethal injection, either in the town square or on TV, demonstrate the price of violating what the state deems as law and order. They serve as an internal policing mechanism, communicating to every member of ISIL the punishment for any \"acts of treason\", or couched in ISIL's terms, \"apostasy\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">ISIL's execution of Kassig, a Muslim convert, was part of a decade-long process within a Muslim civil war, centred on an Islamic State, but with ramifications beyond its borders. Kassig's execution is indicative of a re-articulation of identity within the western world. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Kassig was an <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/world/europe/second-frenchman-is-identified-in-isis-video-of-peter-kassig.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">American convert apparently killed by two French converts</a>. In a tragic irony, Kassig shared something in common with his kidnappers. All three probably left their homes in the US and France respectively to seek out a cause greater than their lives and identities in their western settings. Seeking that cause brought them to the tragic episode that unfolded last week.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Finally, the focus on the religion of the victim, hides something more tragic about Kassig's death. He was simply a human being volunteering as an aid worker to help a lot of Muslims and Christians displaced by the conflict in Syria. The focus on Kassig's conversion was irrelevant. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Similar questions were raised about whether David Haines and Alan Henning might have <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29668473\" target=\"_blank\">converted to Islam before their deaths</a>. These two British aid workers in Syria, beheaded by ISIL, were simply humans who left their comfortable existence in the UK to help other humans dispossessed in Syria. Despite their deaths, the families of all three beheading victims publicly stated that people should not blame Islam for their loss. Both the victims and their families showed compassion and forgiveness in their lifetime. These three men and their families were more Muslim than many Muslims in this world today. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ibrahim al-Marashi is an assistant professor at the Department of History, California State University, San Marcos.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">It's a familiar story, starring African land and outsized corporate appetites. It begins in 1992, when the Tanzanian government licensed Ortelo Business Corporation (OBC) - owned by a senior official of the United Arab Emirates government - to organise hunting expeditions in Loliondo, a 4,000sq km stretch of land on the edge of the Serengeti National Park in northern Tanzania, near the border with Kenya. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The expanse, designated a \"Game Controlled Area\" (the formal designation for territory earmarked for licensed hunting) in 1959, when the country was still under colonial rule, teems with antelopes, lions, leopards, cheetah, wildebeest, and other wildlife. But it has also been, for centuries, home to tens of thousands of people from the pastoral Maasai ethnic group, and grazing ground for their herds. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For close to two decades the Maasai and the foreign trophy-hunters managed to coexist, albeit uneasily. Until 2009, when the Tanzanian government introduced a new law completely outlawing farming and herding in a 1,500sq km stretch of the Game Controlled Area. On the back of that law the police swooped in, assaulting residents and demolishing hundreds of homesteads. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Following protests, including an online petition - <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://avaaz.org/en/save_the_maasai/?slideshow\" target=\"_blank\">\"Stop the Serengeti Sell-off\"</a>, which attracted international attention and now has more than 1.8 million signatures - respite appeared to come the way of the beleaguered communities. In 2013, activist groups claimed the government had backed off.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Renewed government threats</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Now, a year on, the trenches are being re-dug. The Maasai are complaining of renewed government threats; specifically a <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2013/04/20134309749467675.html\" target=\"_blank\">quit notice that will expire by the end of the year</a>. In what is perhaps a sign that the government is determined to go ahead with the eviction, it is reportedly offering the affected communities about $500,000 in compensation. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Were he alive, Julius Nyerere, who led Tanganyika (as Tanzania was then known) to independence in the 1960s, would not be surprised. In his essay, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.nathanielturner.com/ujamaanyerere.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\"Ujamaa: The Basis of African Socialism\"</a>, first published in 1962, he wrote: \"In a country such as this, where, generally speaking, the African are poor and the foreigners are rich, it is quite possible that, within 80 or 100 years, if the poor African were allowed to sell his land, all the land in Tanganyika would belong to wealthy immigrants, and the local people would be tenants.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Nyerere, equating capitalism with exploitation, and seeking to entrench an African version of socialism in Tanzania, vowed that land in the country would never be privately owned. (Admittedly, the success of that ideological experiment is debatable.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As things have turned out in this Tanzanian case, it's not poor African peasants letting go of their land, but their government taking those liberties on their behalf. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There are those who insist this is part of a larger trend across Africa, in which wealthy individuals and large companies acquire large tracts of land (and sometimes water) from cash-strapped governments in developing countries. Critics sum it up as \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9xmvedqHkZsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+land+grabbers&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uJ1dUfDAFOX80QX2z4HoBg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20land%20grabbers&f=false\" target=\"_blank\">land-grabbing</a>\"; Sudan, Malawi, and Ghana are three of the countries that have gone down that route in recent years. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The question that arises is a simple one: Who is looking out for the ordinary people, the ones at the bottom of the ladder, for whom the land at stake is the difference between hunger and a filled stomach; between despondency and a modicum of dignity? Who can we count on to ensure that they are not condemned to getting the short end of the natural resource stick; the way it has happened with oil and diamonds and copper and cocoa all these decades?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">We can almost always be certain it won't be the government, sadly. In the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results\" target=\"_blank\">2013 Corruption Perceptions Index</a>, which measures the extent to which the citizens of a country perceive that country's public service to be corrupt, African countries generally belonged in the bottom. Tanzania occupies 111th place, of 177 countries; even then it is ahead of continental giants Egypt (112th), Kenya (136th), and Nigeria (144th).</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Exploitative African land deals</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Perhaps the gold standard for exploitative African land deals is the one entered into by the Liberian government with US rubber magnate Harvey S Firestone.

The deals were signed in spite of the objections of the Liberian parliament. Firestone is today the largest private employer of labour in the country. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">So, what is the way out? There will be no easy solutions. Xenophobia will always be a tempting, but ill-advised response to news of \"foreigners\" exploiting \"locals\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Land reform is fundamental. There has to be a way to empower communities to have a say in the use and allocation of their land. Last year, the Malawian Parliament passed a new law that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.africareview.com/Business---Finance/New-Malawi-law-bars-foreigners-from-owning-land/-/979184/1871112/-/2iy8rw/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">makes it harder for chiefs to abuse their powers</a> regarding the sale of communal land. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Across the continent, new laws are needed to bridle corporate ambitions and entrench greater transparency in natural resource deals. In many cases, the laws already exist, but are not being implemented.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Judicial and legislative institutions, which exist to checkmate the executive powers of governments, need to be strengthened; as does civil society, which is best placed to leverage information technology to amplify local grievances - as we have seen with the Maasai online petition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The goal would be to ensure that communities are not kept in the dark regarding negotiations that affect their fortunes; and that, even in the face of collusion between corrupt government officials and big business interests, they do not feel helpless. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Already the Maasai are vowing they would rather die than be evicted from their ancestral land. As we have seen in Nigeria, those feelings of helplessness and frustration are ultimately dangerous.</span><em><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Tolu Ogunlesi is an award-winning poet and author.

They do this in favour of the telegraph, the wireless radio or even the newspaper. </span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Imagine then if the Nazis had conducted their Blitzkriegs using these public mediums, instead of the secretive missives more typical of military organisations back then, and indeed today.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> How strange would it then be if Allied intelligence agencies had abruptly accused the contemporary newspaper barons, radio station owners and telegraph operators of acting as \"command and control networks of choice\" for Nazi Germany.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This is the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c89b6c58-6342-11e4-8a63-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3JfJnHjDS\" target=\"_blank\">bizarre argument that Robert Hannigan</a>, the newly appointed head of General Communications Headquarters, made in his first week in the job as head of Britain's secretive national surveillance agency. He argued that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) was using Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp as coordination networks, or propaganda mediums. He accused Silicon Valley of being \"in denial about its misuse\". He asked for more cooperation, alleging these companies were resistant.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Problem of propaganda</span></i></STRONG><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> The nub of Hannigan's rhetoric is that GCHQ would rather ISIL use communication mediums which do not have cooperative offices in the West; servers which are readily accessible to his spooks. He casually over-states the problem of propaganda - warning that ISIL generates 40,000 tweets per day, neglecting to mention <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://m.computing.co.uk/ctg/opinion/2379739/was-gchqs-robert-hannigan-right-or-wrong-to-call-on-tech-firms-to-help-with-terrorism-threat\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter hosts half a billion tweets</a> in that same period.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Instead, Hannigan would prefer ISIL communicate in other ways - methods which would be completely opaque to his agency's surveillance. Perhaps a paper letter, in a country where there are precious few western intelligence agents. Or a carrier pigeon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Aside from the bizarre complaint of how damn easy it is to track these people, Hannigan had another gripe - that Silicon Valley does not do enough to help the intelligence agencies track down the bad guys.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The reality could not be more different.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> As broad background, we now know that more traditional technology firms like Vodafone, British Telecom, and Verizon already <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/telecoms-bt-vodafone-cables-gchq\" target=\"_blank\">gave GCHQ access to the fibre optic cables running a great proportion of the internet</a> under the Atlantic Ocean - equivalent to recording \"all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours\". GCHQ can also access any information the NSA bulk-collects from Silicon Valley, without even getting a warrant.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As publicly listed companies, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp have little interest in being \"command and control centres\" for terrorists, or hosting horrific content. Nothing hurts dividends like a website becoming a trove of extremist filth. Thanks to Snowden, awareness of privacy issues is also at an all-time high, and as<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29894104\" target=\"_blank\"> tech blog The Register put it </a>\"sales of devices and cloud services would plummet should word get out that US tech giants were willing partners in mass surveillance\". </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Encryption measures</span></i></STRONG><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Indeed, the Snowden revelations have seen Silicon tech giants implement a range of end-to-end encryption measures to reassure their users that their most intimate details aren't being exposed wholesale to spies for no reason. Hannigan's piece in the <em>Financial Times </em>is a transparently tactical public relations response to this activity.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But even despite these market risks, evidence suggests that Silicon Valley is collaborating with surveillance agencies anyway - putting Hannigan's view at risk of being painted as pure fantasy.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Twitter, for example, removed a record amount of content from January to June 2014, as made clear in their own <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://transparency.twitter.com/removal-requests/2014/jan-jun\" target=\"_blank\">\"transparency reports\"</a>. Other tech companies run similar programmes. Twitter even removed numerous accounts which didn't correspond to government requests - meaning they proactively went out and found tweeting terrorists, and expelled them.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> As Privacy International also rightly calls out - there are numerous \"official and voluntary<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.cityam.com/1415131599/gchq-chief-robert-hannigan-right-tech-firms-should-do-more-help-fight-terrorism\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.cityam.com/1415131599/gchq-chief-robert-hannigan-right-tech-firms-should-do-more-help-fight-terrorism\" target=\"_blank\">schemes in place\" to allow spooks to access data</a> when needed. The latest documents released by The Intercept suggest that certain, unnamed, US companies knew about the surveillance programmes. Further evidence suggests financial payments were made to Silicon Valley to cover the costs of meeting NSA surveillance requirements. </span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> It may be an attempt to offload blame, but according to NSA's top lawyer - Rajesh De, \"big tech companies . provided <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/us-tech-giants-knew-nsa-data-collection-rajesh-de\" target=\"_blank\">'full assistance'</a> in legally mandated collection of data\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">And as Al Jazeera America recently reported, Google CEO <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/6/nsa-chief-google.html\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Schmidt wrote an email </a>to the head of the NSA, apologising for not attending a collaboration meeting - \"General Keith ... so great to see you ... I'm unlikely to be in California that week so I'm sorry I can't attend [will be on the East Coast]. Would love to see you another time. Thank you!\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The tone doesn't suggest an uncooperative relationship.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ritual lawbreaking </span></i></STRONG><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Hannigan's blaming of Silicon Valley is a crude attempt to launder his agency's reputation for ritual lawbreaking since 2001. He has taken the opportunity of the ISIL crisis haunting public opinion, to cancel out the Snowden revelations and his agency's mass wrongdoing. His comments came shortly after FBI Director <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/11/03/fbi-director-tech-companies-have-to-be-able-to-unlock-device-for-cops/\" target=\"_blank\">James Comey made near identical comments</a> in the US, calling, like Hannigan did, for more collaboration from tech companies. </span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> Writing in the Financial Times, which has an older audience less-versed with Generation Y's obsession with social media, it's easy for GCHQ to paint a picture of newfangled technology being evil, rather than ISIL themselves, or indeed GCHQ or the NSA (in relative terms).</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> There are three words that the unrepentant GCHQ and NSA would do well to remember - before moaning about uncooperative technology companies: <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/2482.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Get a warrant</a>. There is already a perfectly decent system for recovering information from any organisation that provides information conduits for a terrorist, regardless of how cooperative the company may be in the meantime. In many ways, we are extremely lucky that ISIL chooses to use the services of western companies to communicate and propagandise.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> So Hannigan doesn't need to qualitatively criticise the relationship between spying agencies and those companies - the law, a judge, and a warrant can give you all you need.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Alastair Sloan is a London-based journalist.

Most recently the phrase has been applied in reference to the UAE.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Now Iraqi Kurdistan is making a major play to become the next \"Little Sparta\". The Peshmerga - Kurdistan's fighting force - has always enjoyed the admiration and trust of the US military. Now Iraqi Kurdistan is emerging as an unparalleled launchpad for western operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), offering secure bases with easy access to Mosul, eastern Syria and over a thousand kilometres of ISIL's front-line in Iraq. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This week has seen a senior Kurdish delegation making the rounds in Washington DC, lobbying Congressional leaders and think tanks to support a radical tightening of the military ties between the US and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">At the present time, Washington continues to provide most of its weapons and training support to the KRG only after consultation with and approval by the Iraqi Ministry of Defence. In the past, this nod to Iraqi sovereignty has allowed Baghdad to delay or even block US security cooperation with the Kurds. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>'Sense of Congress'</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On November 10, senior US Congressman Ed Royce, the chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, introduced a \"sense of Congress\" resolution that called for US President Barack Obama to \"directly provide the Kurdistan Regional Government with advanced conventional weapons, training, and defence services, on an emergency and temporary basis\". </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The motion explicitly encourages the president to \"accept End Use Certificates approved by the Kurdistan Regional Government\" to allow the KRG to directly receive US \"anti-armour weapons, armoured vehicles, long-range artillery, crew-served weapons and ammunition, secure command and communications equipment, body armour, helmets, logistics equipment, excess defence articles and other military assistance that the president determines to be appropriate\" for a three-year period. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A similar piece of legislation was introduced by another senior Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher on September 19, and is awaiting review by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Neither of these developments can force the US government's hand but they do add to the clamour of voices calling for the US to reverse its standoffish policy towards Iraqi Kurdish autonomy. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On November 7, Obama asked Congress for $1.6bn to train nine Iraqi army and three Peshmerga brigades ahead of the effort to retake the ISIL's  declared capital of Mosul in 2015. A US training site and air base is being developed at Bashur airfield, near the KRG town of Harir. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Larger US effort</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Kurds want a far larger US effort to train over a dozen Peshmerga brigades and they have a good story to tell US legislators. From 2003 to 2011, the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/last-man-standing-u.s.-security-cooperation-and-kurdistans-peshmerga\" target=\"_blank\">US helped the KRG to develop eight of their Peshmerga brigades</a> with just $92m of US support. In contrast, the US built 109 brigades in federal Iraq at a cost of more than $25bn.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The average<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/last-man-standing-u.s.-security-cooperation-and-kurdistans-peshmerga\" target=\"_blank\"> amount invested in each KRG brigade</a> was $11.5m, compared to $229.3m spent on each federal Iraqi brigade. Today, the eight US-assisted Kurdish units are intact, whereas almost a quarter of the federal forces have disintegrated. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Opponents of the KRG's drive for a direct security relationship with the US will instead argue that bypassing Baghdad could hasten the disintegration of Iraq, for instance setting a precedent for the Sunni areas within Iraq to receive arms and training directly from neighbouring states. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The US government will also be hesitant to undermine the new Minister of Defence Khalid al-Ubeidi, a Sunni Arab from Mosul, who visited the KRG Ministry of Peshmerga on November 3 to discuss mutual cooperation. Thus far, Ubeidi has been supportive of both the US plan to train Peshmerga brigades and Germany’s commitment of sufficient equipment to outfit two entire Peshmerga brigades, much of which has already arrived in Erbil unhindered by Baghdad. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Kurds may seek to overcome US objections by offering their cooperation on critical issues. Future advances by the Peshmerga to close the ring around Mosul or shut off terrorist movements along the Syria-Iraq border may be contingent on boosted provision of US equipment and training. The Kurds are also needed to provide training bases for two new federal government brigades being raised in KRG-controlled areas from the survivors of the destroyed Iraqi army and police units. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Road to de facto autonomy</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Leveraging these advantages, Erbil could achieve a more direct security relationship with the US and other western partner nations, representing another milestone on the road towards de facto autonomy. Alongside security relations with foreign states, the KRG is making strides to become economically independent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The interim revenue-sharing agreement announced by KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani and Iraqi Oil Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi on November 14 is an indication that Baghdad grudgingly sees more upside in cooperatively exporting KRG and Kirkuk crude than in maintaining its economic sanctions against Erbil.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Though tough negotiations will follow over the 2015 Iraqi federal budget, the likely outcome will be an arrangement that implicitly allows the Kurds to independently sell around half a million barrels of oil a day in the coming year. The KRG is readying debt financing legislation that will support its energetic efforts to take out sovereign loans from international banks using oil revenues as collateral. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This is statehood by another name, which may be viewed by Iraq's Kurds as good enough for the time being. Regional states may also find the arrangement less threatening than full Kurdish de jure independence. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Michael Knights is the Lafer Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On November 18, t</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">he UN Human Rights Committee passed a <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/11/un-votes-n-korea-abuses-inquiry-report-20141119191249664212.html\" target=\"_blank\">resolution denouncing human rights abuses in North Korea</a>. North Korea indeed has one of the world's most notorious human rights records, but this time, the resolution contains an important twist: It urges that the North Korean regime be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to answer for its crimes. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This decision is likely to be seen by many as a \"strong signal\" sent to the North Korean government, making the North Korean leadership feel more inclined to treat their people with humanity in order to avoid punishment for past crimes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">However, enthusiasm about the resolution is misplaced. In our less than perfect world, the explicit threat of prosecution likely will not ameliorate the sorry human rights situation in North Korea. On the contrary, it is liable to make it even worse.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">North Korea is unique in being the only communist country of East Asia that has yet to follow the stunning successful Chinese reformist model. While China and Vietnam have permitted their population to get rich and be freer than they were in the 1970s, the North Korean government does </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">what it can to maintain the old Stalinist system of total state control. (Admittedly, the North Korean leadership is not very successful in this endeavour because the system is slowly falling apart anyway.) </span></span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Modest relaxation?</span></span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">North Korean decision makers have their reasons for not following the Chinese in reforming their system - at least as long as political issues are concerned. The major reason is fear. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, North Korean decision makers - a few hundred thousand people in the police, party, army - see themselves as cornered. They believe that they cannot afford to relax the level of political and social control to that of China today, because they face a rich and successful South Korea. They suspect that even a modest relaxation will give the common North Korean access to much information about the stunning affluence of South Korea. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Such a relaxation is also likely to make the people less frightened of the government and its police force. In a divided country, this is indeed dangerous because the North Korean people might one day do what East Germans did in 1989: change the government and demand immediate unification with the rich brethren on the other side of the DMZ.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Such a threat does not exist in China. The Beijing leadership does not face a state whose population is twice the size of China and whose per capita GDP is at least 15 times higher but whose people speak the same language and consider themselves to be part of the same nation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">North Korean leaders understand perfectly well that German-style unification with the rich and powerful South will deprive them of power and privileges. However, the loss of power is not their greatest fear: They also believe that should their regime collapse and unification occur under South Korean auspices, all people who were prominent in the North Korean regime will face persecution or die a violent death.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Inter-Korean rivalry</i></STRONG> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is not incidental that the question of the fate of former East German officials after unification is something one is bound to encounter when talking to North Korean officials in private. North Korean officials are perfectly aware of how they would treat the South Korean elite had they successfully won the inter-Korean rivalry and taken over the South.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Indeed, former South Korean officials who found themselves trapped in North Korea during the turbulent days of the Korean War were subject to lifelong official discrimination. Their children and grandchildren still do not have the right to live in major cities, serve in the army, or go to university. The North Korea elite expect to be treated by the victorious Southerners in a very similar way.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The top North Korean leadership has tried to deepen such fears in order to secure support from the lower levels of the elite. When, in 1989, Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's communist dictator, was shot together with his wife, the video of his death was secretly shown to mid-level officials in order to vividly demonstrate the threat that the elite potentially faced. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">There is little doubt that this recent UN resolution will also be used by the North Korean propaganda. It is not going to be seen by average North Korean officials as a signal that they should keep away from human rights abuses. Rather, it will be another confirmation of their worst fears; the proof that they should expect the sorry fate after the regime's end. There is little doubt that most of them will be strengthened in their belief - for the sake of the future of themselves and their loved ones, they should be harsh and forgiving, stop at nothing and exterminate all challenges to the present system with remarkable ferocity.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Andrei Lankov is professor of Korean Studies at Kookmin University, Seoul.

A satellite TV station was calling to check whether I would appear on their news hour to discuss the recent terrorist attack in Jerusalem.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">I had no real clue what the producer was talking about until she explained to me that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/jerusalem-synagogue-attacked-gunmen-201411185401123578.html\" target=\"_blank\">two Palestinians had barged into a synagogue carrying axes</a>, knives and a pistol and had killed five Jewish worshippers. A bracing wake-up call indeed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Over the past five months, Palestine has reinserted itself dramatically into the political imagination of a world that was far too occupied with the brutal and oft-bloody events in parts of the MENA region. But the violence and vengefulness that have sucked Palestinians and Israelis into its vortex over those past months - whether tit-for-tat, price-tag or sheer murder - have also awakened the world community to the fact that they can only ignore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at their peril.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But let me start off first by denouncing and condemning in absolute terms those latest barbarities that have now robbed five people of their sacred lives. I denounce and condemn them - ethically, morally, and legally - with the same vehemence and anguish as I do every single murder and all the orgy of violence that have beset both Palestinians and Israelis in this latest chapter of the <em>lex talionis</em> that gouges eyes for eyes and extracts teeth for teeth. From teenagers hitchhiking to other teenagers going to the mosque for prayer, from places of worship to bus drivers and ordinary men subjected to such atrocious fears in Gaza or Sderot, I denounce, condemn and express sympathy with all bereaved families.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> The chilling question 'why'</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But then I cannot simply stop here, feel that I have expressed human outrage and leave the issue incomplete in my own political mind: I ask myself the question as to what could possibly lead any human being to commit such atrocities? And here is where I refuse to venture into spurious theories of relativism but I do ask myself the chilling question \"why\"? If I do not ask this powerful three-letter question, then in the language of criminal lawyers I am denouncing and condemning an <em>actus reus</em> or a sordid deed but not exploring the <em>mens rea</em> or the state of mind motivating such life-robbing acts.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Imagine that you are living in your own house and trying to cope with your daily life and that of your family. Someone barges in by blasting the door of your house open, takes over four of the six rooms in your house for his use or that of his relatives or friends. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Not only that, but he starts erecting partitions, changes the code on your alarm system and then settles in your garden to enjoy a nice evening while you - the owner of the house - is literally imprisoned in the remaining two rooms. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">You get angry, you protest, you negotiate, you threaten, you pray and blaspheme at one and the same time, and yet the invader does not give a hoot about your rights or budge an inch. He has the firepower and he has decided that he will take over your house because it is on land that he deems precious or useful to him. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Disempowered and intimidated, you appeal to the neighbours: They are deaf. You seek out the mayor of your borough: He is blinkered to what is occurring in your house and probably supports the invaders who are kith or kin. You seek out your religious leader: He is absent talking to his Almighty as if prayer without action is enough for any believer. Finally, you see the look of pain in your kids' eyes and so you flip and decide to kick him out of your house even if it means killing him and yourself in the process. The sad result is that the police immediately surround your house, take you to the police station and throw you in jail. After all, how dare you resist the invasion and occupation of your own house? This is one sad outcome of structural and institutional violence although not a justification for it. But surely, it is abhorrent towards any human being?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Welcome to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to its festering realities let alone its prurient injustices.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Biblical imperatives</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">No matter the biblical imperatives and their exegeses, one people have been dispossessed of their properties and their country was occupied by another people.

Their rights have been violated, their residences in their very birthplaces compromised and their natural resources plundered with sheer impunity. Their leaders have been demonised or reviled, their attempts at peacemaking thwarted, their memories trashed in political bins.</span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Many of their Arab neighbours - purportedly their brothers - who claimed to love them have forsaken them while the wider world has stood idly by and come up with lamentable statements of compassion that are tantamount only to lame excuses.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Again, I denounce and condemn every act of violence against any human being as a non-negotiable aberration of our shared humanity. But this does not also mean that I do not understand that every human being - every man, woman and child no matter their ethnicity, colour, religion or background - is entitled to hope, dignity and justice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">If my Israeli friends seek my compassion about those needless murders that are a stain on the collective conscience of a whole world, they have it unreservedly. If they expect empathy and also profound sadness for the losses suffered by Israeli and Palestinian families, I grieve with them all. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But if they expect me to act dumb and feign that a downtrodden people should remain crippled, with no rights, homeland or future of their own and that they are not permitted to aspire for their freedom and self-determination, then I am being treated with the same disdain shown to those under occupation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">If you ask me to keep mum when one people is humiliated constantly, I rue that I cannot do that either no matter the geopolitics of the region.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">I regret that this is where we might well part ways: After all, it is in the very freedom of others that I find the essence and meaning for my own freedom - be that in Jerusalem, London, Yerevan or elsewhere in our muddled global village.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Dr Harry Hagopian is a London-based international lawyer, political adviser and ecumenical consultant on the MENA region.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iranians love bargaining - it<span lang=\"FR\">'</span>s a national pastime - and with Iranians<span lang=\"FR\">' </span>goal for a good bargain in mind, business owners usually increase the asking price to buffer against the decrease from bargaining. Walking away with a bargain psychologically gives Iranians satisfaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A few years ago at the Columbia University campus in New York City, I asked a florist whether I could purchase the purple orchids at the same price as the cheaper white orchids. Instead of answering me, he asked whether I was Iranian. Puzzled by his question, I confirmed that I was: \"Well, then, you can have it at the price as you asked for.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Surprising even the other customers, he explained that he had lived in Los Angeles and had mingled with the Iranian community there. He was quite aware of the bargaining culture explaining: \"Iranians can<span lang=\"FR\">'</span>t sleep if they shopped without negotiating for a better price.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This national pastime extends even towards international relations, as is the case as Iran and the western powers referred to as the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany) negotiate over Iran<span lang=\"FR\">'</span>s nuclear programme.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Failed to capitalise</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">During the period of the interim deal, which was signed in Geneva almost a year ago and was extended on July 20, both sides did everything in their power to narrow the gap, but western countries failed to capitalise on the Iranian national pastime, <em>chaneh zani</em>. Literally meaning \"bargaining\", <em>chaneh zani </em>is a word frequently used in Iranian press when writing on Iran<span lang=\"FR\">'</span>s nuclear talks with western powers usually demanding the Iranian negotiating team to bargain better for the country.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Now, with time running out for Iran and the negotiators to reach a comprehensive deal by the November 24 deadline, the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2014/11/no-nuclear-deal-with-iran-as-deadline-looms-2014112113224502898.html\" target=\"_blank\">negotiators are in Vienna working even harder</a>. But so far there is no sign of reaching a deal by the expected time. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With less than three days to the deadline, parties are bargaining hard and blaming the other side for not being flexible and asking for compromise. Anxiety surrounds those Iranians who support the negotiators - they fear the consequences of failed talks on the economy and their livelihoods.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iranians are not the only ones worried. Gripped by a similar fear of failed talks and its repercussion for the region, Iran's Arab neighbours are finally engaging by offering a hand to mediate between Iran and the US and boost the nuclear talks. A week ago, Oman hosted trilateral meetings between Iran, the US and EU's representative Catherine Ashton, in order to narrow the gap and make the path ready before November 24. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Oman's foreign minister told reporters in Muscat that his country has the support of all Gulf countries. Minister Yousef ben Alawai asked Iran and the US to seize the momentum and make peace. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What remains as the key difference and the gaps that the parties are referring to is apparently more political than technical. According to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/11/19/386608/iran-fm-p51s-political-will-needed-for-final-nuclear-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif</a>, the Iranian nuclear programme is a real and peaceful programme and \"cannot be wished, sanctioned or coerced away\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iranians expected negotiators to bargain the best deal and it seems that the government chose well in appointing Zarif as their chief nuclear negotiator. Earlier this year, Zarif made the best possible deal for Iran after a 10-year struggle with P5+1 over the nuclear file but it is too early to tell whether this top negotiator can take what Iranians are expecting and reach a comprehensive deal.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Fuel matters</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Apparently Iran<span lang=\"FR\">'</span>s demand to produce its own fuel for the 1,000-megawatt power plant faced resistance by the western negotiators. Russia, which built the nuclear reactor in Bushehr, has a 10-year contract to supply the fuel starting in 2011. In other words, for the next seven years, Iran should have no issues regarding fuel.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Now Iran is bargaining for its needs to generate its own fuel for the reactor after 2021, and for the new power plants which are going to be built in the future.</span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iran wants all sanctions to be lifted upon a comprehensive deal, but revoking the sanctions will not be as easy as Iranians are expecting and bargaining for.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Despite the hopes for reaching a comprehensive and historical agreement, after a week of intense negotiations in Vienna, the parties may decide to continue the talks beyond the deadline in the form of another short extension.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Certainly an extension isn<span lang=\"FR\">'</span>t exactly what Iranians are looking for but the positive atmosphere shows Iranians that their dream of a better economy and international recognition of their nuclear programme is still possible.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Of course, both sides have opponents to the process who see the extension as a sign of difficulties for Iran to secure a comprehensive deal. Particularly the hardliners in Iran who have been waiting for the talks to fall apart may be in a celebratory mood as well as US President Barack Obama's opponents in the new Congress to form on January 2, 2015. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">What Iran is basically trying so hard to achieve is securing the nation<span lang=\"FR\">'</span>s right to nuclear energy, but this cannot be separated from the cultural habit of bargaining.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Unfortunately, as is often the case, pushing too hard for a bargain can backfire. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday: \"If the opposite party of the negotiations has the political will for the deal and avoids excessive demands, the conditions are prepared for the conclusion of the deal.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Camelia Entekhabifard is an Iranian journalist, TV commentator and author of Camelia: Save Yourself by Telling the Truth - a Memoir of Iran. </span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Nothing will stick more in the minds of voters in Tunisia's presidential election of November 23 than the nickname \"Bajbouj\". It is today the most uttered term of endearment referring to 88-year-old Beji Caid Essebsi, a seasoned politician, </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">and the closest thing Tunisians have to a presidential frontrunner. He is the oldest presidential candidate in a nascent democracy in new Tunisia. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The irony in all of this, he seems to be the favourite to win.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Since Nidaa Tounes's victory in the parliamentary election of November 23, \"Beji mania\" has gripped Tunisia. A giant billboard in perfect \"Tunisois\" dialect (Tunis-based slang laced with French words) reads \"<em>hayya sawwit lil-bajbouji, khalli libled tbouji</em>\". A catchy electoral phrase, easily understood by the lay voter, enlists citizens' support, more or less along the lines of \"vote for Bajbouj, make the country move forward\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Here lies the biggest secret weapon of Nidaa Tounes and its elder statesman: speaking the language of the multitude, which any Tunisian can readily understand. This, along with the quasi Bourguiba-speak smokescreen, a populist device that lures voters in the populous northern and coastal cities of the country, have helped the charismatic Essebsi ride on a wave of popularity unprecedented since the 2011 revolution.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Beguiling puzzle</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In the race to elect Tunisia's fifth president, there is more than one puzzle that beguiles. Essebsi, as the latest reincarnation of the Bourguiba style, seems to blind Tunisians to the instability of the last years of the country's father of independence: senility, misrule, and incessant obsession with succession. Bajbouj may today be popular, kindling nostalgia to the vigorous early years and certainties of Bourguiba's political know-how and socio-cultural renewal. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Tomorrow, however, if elected to the highest office in the land, Essebsi will bring to the presidency worries over his rumoured ill-health and rivalry over succession - not to mention the return to political centre-stage of old associates of Ben Ali.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Another puzzle regards the fact that had it not been for the ballot and the democratic constitution governing the multi-candidate presidential election, one would be forgiven to think that nothing seems to remain of Tunisia’s 2011 revolution. Except one thing: orderly practice of political participation and contestation in what thus far has been a troubled and yet sustainable process of democratic transition - the only one of its kind in the Arab Spring geography.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">No one stands out as particularly revolutionary among the 23 presidential wannabes in Tunisia. \"Bajbouj\" and revolution do not go hand in hand. Nor do revolution and his most serious rival in the presidential race, the incumbent, 69-year-old Moncef Marzouki. By any standards, however, Marzouki, who made his stamp on the country's politics through alliance with the Islamists and dissidence on behalf of human rights, comes across as a \"radical\" by comparison.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Despite favourable ratings, the election will not be a cakewalk for Essebsi. There could be a second round on December 28 - head-to-head between Essebsi and Marzouki. Some expect Tunisia's women to opt for former dissident magistrate Kalthoum Kannou, the only female presidential hopeful, but the race is not expected to be upended by Kannou as its dark horse.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Dark horse</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In a true electoral sense, the race's dark horse is 42-year-old Slim Riahi, the self-made billionaire - berated by many for alleged past business association with Libya's former ruling house, the Gaddafi family. He can rely more on football fans' support than can Kannou on that of female voters, many of whom may already have partisan loyalties that cannot be easily switched when voting on November 23.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Riahi has since 2012 owned Tunisia's second biggest and most successful top division football team (Club Africain). Already he surprised political pundits by his party, Free Patriotic Union, coming third in last month’s parliamentary election (winning 16 seats, one more than the leftist Popular Front of presidential candidate Hamma Hammami). Riahi can rely on money, publicity and a popular football team to propel him into the presidency. This is unlikely. Financial largesse is no solution to his lacklustre demeanour.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">There are two key takeaways. The first is that as the race tightens in the coming days, Marzouki can increasingly rely on the vote of shocked Nahda Party members whose biggest fear after defeat in the parliamentary election in October is to see former Ben Ali associates and anti-Islamist leftists, from Nidaa Tounes, winning the presidency. Likewise, members of the so-called Destourian Movement, adherents and campaigners of Bourguiba's politics, will rally around Essebsi.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The second is that if the country's political culture is any guide, Tunisia's next president will hail from a <em>Beldi</em> (urban bourgeoisie of Tunis), and not an <em>Afaqi</em> (provincial) background, have a modernist outlook, and his politics will favour incremental reform via evolution, not revolution.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Larbi Sadiki is a specialist in Arab democratisation, revolution and transitions, and has been an academic at Australian National University, Exeter University, Westminster University and Qatar University.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Since attaining independence in 1971, Qatari foreign policy has passed through various phases. Two turning points have marked its development: the transfer of power to Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani in 1995 and his recent abdication of power to Crown Prince Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani in June 2013.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Like in other Gulf states, Qatar's foreign policy was generally in agreement with the foreign policy of the Saudi government until the mid-1990's, when Doha carved its own independent path under the leadership of Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Adopting an \"open\" foreign policy, which relied on soft power tools such as media, diplomacy, education, culture, sports, tourism, economy and humanitarian aid, Doha's strategy was based on good relations with neighbours, the formation of strategic alliances with major and medium powers and the building of a brand.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Since the current ruler came to power after his father abdicated in June 2013 (a move unprecedented in modern Arab history), the Arab region has undergone several substantial changes that have reshaped the geopolitical landscape and regional power balances. The most significant of these are: the ousting of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, the escalation of the conflict in Libya, the territorial expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and the Houthi takeover of major state institutions in Yemen. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Each of these events, among others, has undoubtedly impacted Doha's foreign policy.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><strong style=\"line-height: 115%; font-size: 13px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The impact of the Arab Spring </span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Qatar's international relations doctrine focuses on the consolidation of peace and stability, as proscribed by its constitution. </span><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is based on the principles of encouraging settlement of international disputes by peaceful means, supporting the right of people to self-determination, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, and cooperation with peace-loving nations.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Since the mid-1990s successive Qatari governments have upheld these principles. Before the outbreak of the so-called \"Arab Spring\", then Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani adopted diplomacy that focused on mediation and conflict resolution. Doha assumed the role of mediator in almost every regional conflict: from Sudan to Eritrea, Lebanon to the Palestine, and Somalia to Yemen.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The positive results of this mediatory role secured recognition and credibility for Qatar at both the regional and international levels; this was the case with Qatar's mediation of the 2007 release of the Bulgarian nurses and Palestinian doctor from detention in Libya and the Lebanon agreement of May 2008. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">For fifteen years, Qatar's foreign policy was distinguished by its neutrality and impartiality, until December 2010 when the outbreak of the \"Arab Spring\" protests catalysed a historic shift in the political landscape of the region.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Consequently, the country's international image changed, with Qatar being regarded as an active supporter rather than a conciliating mediator. Qatar participated in military action in April 2011 under the NATO-led international coalition against the forces of the late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. As part of the Arab League, Qatar also called for Arab troops to be sent to Syria to stop the bloodshed there.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The Arab Spring and Qatar's consistent position on it, as well as the positions of international and regional powers, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), provided an opportunity to begin a new phase in Qatari foreign policy, aligned with the vision of Doha's political leadership at the time.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Qatar's policy of \"impact and influence\" has enjoyed considerable success, thanks to the changing political climate and divided geopolitical structures across the region under the influence of the Arab Spring. This substantial shift in Qatar's foreign policy appears to reflect its confidence both in independent decision-making and its ability to perform on par with other countries in the region.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">A shift to 'smart power'</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">When Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani came to power, Qatar's style of diplomacy changed significantly, in line with various recent developments in the region, particularly in Egypt, Iraq and Syria. Qatar's foreign policy tools underwent a remarkable development with respect to the conceptualisation of both soft power and smart power. These developments forced the Qatari leadership to adapt and rationally reshape its policies in accordance with changing priorities.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Qatar's diplomatic moves were somewhat quiet when compared with its previous stance, which can be attributed to the young Emir's desire to strategically shape his country's foreign policy, combining both soft and hard power approaches, while maintaining the constitutional principles underpinning Qatar's foreign policy.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The new Qatari leadership is paying increased attention to internal affairs, especially since the country appears to be the target of a systematic campaign by Western media, supported by several organisations and countries that do not agree with Qatar's foreign policy on various regional issues. It is worth noting here that Qatari officials do not deny that there are problems and deficits regarding the rights of expatriate labourers. The relevant state departments have initiated legislation to address those problems, especially since Qatar seeks to implement and achieve its sustainable development goals by 2030. It is also preparing to host international sports tournaments, most importantly the World Handball Championship in 2015 and the FIFA World Cup in 2022.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Qatar's decision-makers have adopted an open-door policy for dialogue with all parties wherever feasible, with an explicit emphasis on not excluding any group from the political scene. Because this stance contradicts that of certain neighbouring countries which chose to confront some political Islam movements, it has fuelled disagreements within the GCC, and led to three members withdrawing their ambassadors from Doha in March 2014. Undoubtedly, this constituted the biggest challenge that Sheikh Tamim faced during the first year of his reign. This unprecedented crisis in the history of intra-GCC relations highlighted Qatar's autonomous political decision-making and its capacity to maintain an independent strategy without necessarily being hostile to other regional countries.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The reaction from Qatar's side showed its flexibility and willingness to overcome the crisis and was reinforced in the Emir's speeches in Germany and at the UN in September 2014, as well as in his interview for CNN. An analysis of these events highlights new and old features of Qatar's foreign policy, which suggests that it has been adjusted without compromising the fundamental principles laid out in the constitution.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The principle of mediation remains one of its most important features, with Doha becoming a model in solving regional and international conflicts and earning its status as the \"Geneva of the Mashreq\".</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In recent international forums Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani has called for a culture of dialogue and \"preventive diplomacy\" through pre-emptive peaceful methods rather than pre-emptive war, and has supported governments implementing gradual reforms. All signs suggest that Doha wishes to explore more flexible approaches than those adopted after the outbreak of the Arab Spring, without changing its foreign policy fundamentals. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is worth mentioning the consistency with which Qatari decision-makers have supported the rights of Arab nations to demand freedom and dignity and their right to a better life rather than a forced choice between the tyranny of authoritarian regimes and the terrorism of jihadist organisations resulting from these tyrannies.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;\"><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: small;\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><em>Dr Jamal Abdullah is a r</em></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><em>esearcher specialising in Gulf affairs at Al Jazeera Centre for Studies.</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></i></STRONG></p>"

      },
      "body": {
        "#cdata-section": "<p><span dir=\"ltr\">China's rapid emergence as a full-spectrum regional power has placed Asia on the cusp of a major geopolitical shift, rekindling ancient memories of a Sino-centric order in the region. The recent summits in China (APEC) and Myanmar (ASEAN) have potently demonstrated China's ever-expanding global ambitions and its determination to supplant a US-led order in the region. For almost seven decades, the US has served as the undisputed hegemonic power in East Asia. In recent years, however, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/will-china-ever-be-no-1\" target=\"_blank\">China seems to have abandoned Deng Xiaoping's</a> famous dictum: \"Hide your strength, bide your time.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Under Xi Jinping, China's first paramount leader in decades, China has accelerated its efforts at challenging American hegemony, on both economic and military fronts. Without a doubt, China's rising economic power has provided tremendous opportunities for neighbouring countries and much of the world. As a global factory, China has provided affordable products for consumers across the world, a large pool of surplus labour for global industries, and affordable loans and technology to developing countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Military behemoth </span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">But China's growing military muscle has raised alarm bells across the Asia-Pacific theatre and beyond. Today, China is a member of an exclusive club of nations with <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/chinas-submarine-fleet-adds-nuclear-strike-capability-altering-strategic-balance-undersea-1414164738\" target=\"_blank\">ocean-roaming nuclear submarines</a>, an aircraft carrier, and two active stealth fighter (J-20 and J-21) programmes. It has the world's <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/china/21599046-chinas-fast-growing-defence-budget-worries-its-neighbours-not-every-trend-its-favour\" target=\"_blank\">second largest military budget</a>, with a rapidly advancing asymmetrical military capability, which is aimed at denying the US navy access to China-claimed waters and territories in the Western Pacific. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">The US, by far, remains the world's most powerful military, but Beijing, with astonishing speed, has chipped away at this superiority.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Throughout the post-Cold War period, the Chinese leadership made a concerted effort to modernise a bloated, antiquated People's Liberation Army (PLA), which was predominantly oriented towards continental warfare.</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Quick and lethal US military victories against its enemies, especially Saddam Hussein's (Soviet-equipped) military in 1991, encouraged the PLA to step up its capabilities in both advanced, hi-tech \"information warfare\" as well as asymmetrical warfare, the so-called \"anti-access/area-denial\" </span><span lang=\"EN-PH\">(A2/AD) capabilities. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">As Harry Kazianis, an expert on Chinese military affairs, recently told me: \"China, for the foreseeable future, will not be able to match America's [conventional military]… Overtime, however, Beijing will have the capabilities to create an ever increasing 'no-go zone'\" across the Western Pacific. Unlike the US, which often acts as the global policeman across multiple theatres of conflict, China has the luxury of concentrating all its forces in its immediate neighbourhood. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">So even if China can't match the US military muscle for decades to come, it can, nevertheless, focus on enhancing its strategic position in the Western Pacific. This partly explains why China has stepped up its territorial claims, paramilitary patrols, military drills, and construction activities in adjacent waters, especially the South China Sea.  </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Challenging Pax Americana </span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">In the recently concluded APEC Summit in Beijing, the Chinese leader called for a China-led regional trading agreement, the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). To up the ante, China, during the ASEAN summit, promoted its New Silk Road strategy, offering large-scale capital and infrastructure development schemes to countries across the Eurasian landmass as well as the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Worried by the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21631797-america-needs-push-free-trade-pact-pacific-more-vigorously-americas-big-bet\" target=\"_blank\">potential loss of its economic influence, the US</a>, which is pushing for its own version of a pan-regional free trading agreement (ie, the Tran-Pacific Partnership) has reportedly opposed the commencement of a feasibility study on the FTAAP, while persuading its top allies to boycott the China-led newly inaugurated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is set to compete against the Japan-led Asian Development Bank.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-PH\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">From the perspective of many Asian countries, the burgeoning Sino-American economic rivalry means more trade, investment, and large-scale financing opportunities. Economic competition is largely a healthy rivalry. But Sino-American military competition is an entirely different matter. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">During US President Barack Obama's recent visit to Beijing, the PLA openly flaunted its latest stealth fighter prototype (J-31), which some believe are based on hacked designs of Pentagon's F-35 stealth fighter programme. In 2011, the PLA pulled off a similar stunt, when it boasted its other 5th-generation fighter (J-20) during then US Defense Secretary Robert Gates' visit to China. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">The aim was clear: To remind the US that China is rapidly catching up in military terms. Alarmed by China's growing cyber-technology capabilities, the US, earlier this year, went so far as charging certain elements of the PLA with the alleged theft of trade secrets and sensitive commercial information from US companies. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Meanwhile, US defence officials have repeatedly called upon their Chinese counterparts to welcome greater cooperation (or less confrontation) and dialogue in the realm of cyber warfare. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">The greatest source of concern, however, are <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83c0b88e-0732-11e4-81c6-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">China's coercive manoeuvres</a> in the Western Pacific, ranging from the harassment of foreign fishing vessels and construction of military garrisons on disputed features, to the (existing and impending) imposition of Air Defence Identification Zone over international waters. There is also growing concern over the rising frequency of incidents involving PLA jet fighters and Chinese para-military vessels taking bold actions against American and Japanese forces, risking a full-blown military escalation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Overall, it is increasingly clear that China is no longer just an economic powerhouse. An ascendant China - driven by popular nationalism and equipped with advanced technology and vast human and financial capital - has begun to flex its muscle in its backyard like never before.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span lang=\"EN-PH\">Richard Javad Heydarian is a specialist in Asian geopolitical/economic affairs and author of \"How Capitalism Failed the Arab World: The Economic Roots and Precarious Future of the Middle East Uprisings.\"</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">A<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/11/2014111710237506108.html\" target=\"_blank\"> demonstration in Nairobi</a> protesting the public stripping and humiliation of a supposedly under-dressed woman has brought global attention to a controversy that has been raging in the Kenyan press and online community. Much of the brouhaha has, perhaps predictably, focused on the supposed tension between women's rights and a societally prescribed morality. Much less has been said of how it illustrates a residual fear among some Kenyans of the consequences of respecting individual liberties.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Let's get the obvious out of the way. The shouting matches on Twitter and elsewhere about women's dress choice are really about the rights of individuals, and especially women, to make their own choices and live by their own standards. They are also about the power of any group within a society to decide what is decent and thus what is allowable - to police not just dress, but choice and thought and speech.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">They are part of a wider assault on rights and choices that is perhaps a backlash against the gains achieved in the last three decades. In 2010, the country enacted what was at the time hailed as a progressive constitution, one that codified many of the demands for political and individual freedoms into a bill of rights. However, implementation of the document has proven to be much harder than anticipated. Kenya's entrenched political elite has attempted to hollow out and subvert the reform agenda in a bid to retain many of the privileges that they formerly enjoyed.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Arbitrary and coercive powers</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Instead of adopting and implementing new laws to bring the country in line with the constitution, the political elite are engaged in an effort to restore the arbitrary and coercive powers of the extractive state. In doing this, they have suckered many Kenyans into believing that it is civil and political liberties that are the problem, not the refusal to implement the law.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Thus many seem to see individual rights and choices as a harbinger of chaos or to equate order with a restriction of such. Over and over, we are told that \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://mobile.nation.co.ke/blogs/Standard-Gauge-Railway-Project-Infrastructure/-/1949942/2463088/-/format/xhtml/-/faspwb/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">the constitutional reform process has left people with an exaggerated sense of rights</a>\", and that this is at the root of the inability of the authorities to tackle rising crime and insecurity, and the failure to enforce the rule of law. The right to bail, not the paucity of investigations and evidence, is assailed as a barrier to the state jailing suspected terrorists and poachers. Rights to privacy are held up as impediments in the war against terror just as rights to personal choices are held to be the causes of the supposed moral breakdown of society.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This is, of course, not very different from the excuses regularly offered up for the policing of women. According to <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Rachel Spronk</span>, in her book <em>Ambiguous Pleasures: Sexuality and Middle Class Self-perceptions in Nairobi</em>, \"sexuality is perceived in every society as essential to the social and moral order\". Its control is thus considered crucial to social cohesion. This reasoning is not, as many seem to suggest, a preserve of the poor and uneducated. As Spronk continues to note, in Kenya, \"different groups of men, such as religious leaders, opinion makers in the media and government authorities, have expressed concern about women who have become 'visible' through the transformations of the last decade\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This gives rise to the crude assertions that it is not the violence and humiliation visited upon women that is a threat to order, but rather it is the rights they have won in recent times, the ability to determine their own standards of sexuality, dress and propriety.

        "#cdata-section": "<p>We are convinced that the greatest revolution in forensic science and human rights is happening in Mexico. This revolution is in the hands of relatives of disappeared persons, who silently, but consistently, have embodied a new form of scientific and political citizenship. People working in factories, office jobs or dedicated to commerce who used to be apolitical have become active agents of change due to the disappearance of a loved person.</p>\r\n<p><span>This \"awakening\" (as many relatives describe it) can be exemplified by Letty \"Roy Rivera\" Hidalgo, mother of two and former teacher, that after the abduction of Roy Rivera from her own house in Monterrey Nuevo Leon, has become one of the most active leaders in the search for the disappeared in Mexico. The transformation of Letty started after waiting for months for police officers to do their job. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In the face of their dereliction of duty, Letty started her own search for truth. Armed with basic knowledge of computer systems, Letty learnt how to trace the calls that were made from the mobile phone that her son was carrying that day. After a couple of days she managed to find sixteen locations from where the mobile phone of her son had been calling. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>She even took photos of these houses and took the evidence to the pertinent local authority. Then, she insisted for weeks to the local authorities in Nuevo Leon, who finally decided to visit one of the locations she gave them. Inside, they found three persons who had just been kidnapped; along with guns and members of organised crime. Nonetheless her son was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>Regardless of her success in locating the so called \"security houses\" (places in which kidnapped people are kept), the authorities decided to dismiss her petitions to look into the other possible locations. Four years on and she is still looking for her son. But now, she does the same for hundreds of people who have disappeared in Mexico through <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://fundenl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FUNDENL</a>, the organisation that she leads. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Together with other relatives of disappeared persons in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Letty has been fundamental in organising effective opposition to \"governmental truths\", including the first ever citizen-led exhumation in 2014, supported by the Team of Peruvian Forensic Anthropologists and the recently created <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://cfc.kzen.mx/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen-Led Forensics</a> (or Ciencia Forense Ciudadana in Spanish) , and its partner organisation <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://gobernanzaforense.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gobernanza Forense Ciudadana</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Letty is just one of the sixteen members that today, are part of Citizen-Led Forensics, an ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council, UK) sponsored project based at Durham University that aims to transform the relationship between science and its \"publics\" as we know it. The idea for this project was born in 2011 while living in Colombia and doing an ethnographic research on forensic science. It was then where we thought of a new model to make the right to the truth a reality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Our feasibility study, carried out during 2013 was possible thanks to the support we received when Arely won the Global Impact Competition of Singularity University in 2012. The idea was to analyse the possibility that relatives of the disappeared could govern technologies usually controlled by \"experts\" to find the truth about the whereabouts of their loved ones. By the time we finished this first ethnographic study, Mexico had almost reached half of the death toll, and approximately half the number of disappeared persons that Colombia reached in <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/\" target=\"_blank\">50 years of violent conflict</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The innovation at the heart of Citizen-Led Forensics is simple. Along with relatives of disappeared persons we have created a budding forensic system in which tools such as DNA and forensic databases are public goods, governed by people that have become forensic experts in their own right, while searching for their loved ones. We are convinced this project is a game changer because it breaks the monopoly of truth of the State.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>According to Human Rights Watch and the Mexican Commission of Human Rights, since 2006 there have been approximately <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/12/mexico-build-accurate-database-disappeared\" target=\"_blank\">27,000 disappeared persons</a> in Mexico and the numbers are still rising. Even more, none of these numbers count the thousands of migrants that have disappeared in their transit through Mexico. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>In Citizen-Led Forensics we believe that \"<em>the path of the one is the path of the many\"</em>. That is why we need to create a transparent national database. We cannot keep searching for the disappeared 43 at a time. The revolution in human rights and forensic science we are envisioning cannot be possible if we do not start changing the rules of the game one by one. This means that we have to break in the pristine spaces, reserved for scientific experts and bring the public forum back to forensic science. Thus we say, rephrasing <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/12-GIVE-ME-A-LAB-GB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bruno Latour</a>: \"Let us into your laboratories and we will change the world.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Ernesto Schwartz-Marin holds a PhD in Genetics in Society from University of Exeter, UK.

Yes and no. It is quite a significant and consequential political achievement. But it is not particularly important in its direct effect on greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Whether the agreement ultimately matters to the fate of the world will depend on whether its political impact turns out to be catalytic, spurring not just other political agreements between the world's leading greenhouse gas emitters but - quickly - aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas pollution.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">First, as to the agreement's political significance. Progress in international climate negotiations and even in US domestic policy has long been handcuffed by disagreements about the allocation of responsibility for action among rich and poor countries, and particularly between the US and China.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">China clearly has the upper hand in this debate. It is plainly true that the industrialised countries are responsible for the overwhelming share of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. It is also plainly true that the richer countries have more capacity to make needed investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And, it should be obvious that facing a genuinely global threat, the rich need to do more than the poor, just as rich families need to pay more in taxes than poor families to pay for schools, police, hospitals, roads and other public goods.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Countervailing realities</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, there are certain countervailing realities. The most important is that, thanks to its spectacular growth over the last several decades, China is now the<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/global.html#four\" target=\"_blank\"> world's largest emitter of carbon</a> (though it remains behind the US and other rich countries on a per capita basis). Achieving the needed radical reductions in greenhouse gas pollution will require major action from China (and India, and other developing countries). </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, the US-China trade balance has become so unbalanced that it is economically challenging to impose unilateral costs on US manufacturers (unless they are protected against more carbon-intense imports) and an even bigger problem in terms of domestic US politics.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Against this backdrop, a deal - even a voluntary one - in which both the US and China agree to responsibility for controlling their greenhouse gas emissions is a political breakthrough. It suddenly makes it possible to make progress in world climate talks, and it removes one of the biggest political impediments to the US taking meaningful action on its own and to signing onto a global agreement.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The problem is that this politically significant agreement is incredibly unambitious when it comes to actually reducing greenhouse gas pollution. In the deal, the US agrees to reduce carbon emissions 30 percent from its 2005 level by 2030, and China agrees to keep its 2030 emissions level the same as 2005. This is far too little, and far too slow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On the US side, the promised reduction is not only not enough, it's pretty close to what the US is going to achieve anyway. The Obama administration has been far too slow and modest in policy-making, but it has significantly increased auto fuel efficiency standards, and it is working now on rules that will also reduce emissions from coal plants and hopefully natural gas, as well. Additionally, market forces are now kicking in so that some meaningful reductions are inevitable without any government intervention; investments in energy efficiency are cost-effective right now throughout the economy - meaning it is cheaper to invest in insulation, better windows, better lighting, more efficient industrial commitment, etc, than to pay increased electricity costs. And, wind and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://pubc.it/1wMEw8r\" target=\"_blank\">solar energy output is soaring</a> and costs plummeting. In many cases already, wind is cheaper than coal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Roughly the same holds on the Chinese side. Although the government should be credited for pushing out support for solar and wind energy development, simple cost accounting is now increasingly favouring efficiency, wind and solar over fossil fuels. Many analysts believe <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://theconversation.com/factcheck-does-the-new-climate-deal-let-china-do-nothing-for-16-years-34239\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"InternalLink\">China is</span> already on track</a> to achieve exactly the level promised in the US deal, without any or much additional government action.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There's not really any mystery about what the world needs to do to avert catastrophic climate change, and there isn't much difference between the national and global agendas. We need massive investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The good news is that, over time, these investments will lower our energy costs. The sun and the wind are free; we just to have to get better at harvesting their energy - major strides have already been made in the last decade. We need large-scale transfers of know-how (intellectual property) and resources from rich to poor countries to speed the transition to a carbon-free future, as well as to help poorer countries adapt to the serious costs that even moderated climate change will impose. And, we have to do all this quickly, because energy savings today are much more important than those in 2045, or even 2030.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">All of this is doable, but it won't happen on its own. That's why we need binding intergovernmental commitments. The US-China deal doesn't do much to reduce greenhouse gas pollution on its own; we have to hope that it does pave the way for future political deals to do just that.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Robert Weissman is president of Public Citizen.</span></em></i></STRONG></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span>They are horrifying images of a house of prayer drenched in blood. That an ultra-orthodox synagogue in West Jerusalem was chosen for this latest, gruesome attack, in which four Jewish-Israeli men were killed by two knife-wielding Palestinians, has detonated appalling historic associations and has been widely condemned. This attack has also, inevitably, sparked descriptions of a \"religious war\" in the region - depicted in media headlines as being in various stages of development: either a current reality or an unavoidably impending one. Those who insist on stressing the religious dimension are bolstered by the reaction from Hamas to this attack, as the Islamist group has, with bleak predictability, praised and celebrated it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>And once again the media framing designates the starting point - and therefore, implicitly, the causes - of the current bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians. Most importantly, in this context, is the question of who or what set off the religious incitement in Jerusalem.</span></p>\r\n<p>The Israeli government has repeatedly <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/israel-blames-abbas-synagogue-attack-vows-response-103629955.html\" target=\"_blank\">blamed the Palestinian Authority</a> president, Mahmoud Abbas.</p>\r\n<p>But its own security services quickly quashed such accusations: Shin Bet chief, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.627173\" target=\"_blank\">Yoram Cohen, told a Knesset</a> committee that Abbas (who has no control over Jerusalem) was not involved in igniting violence among East Jerusalem Palestinians.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, Cohen added, if anyone could be <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4593516,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">accused of exacerbating tensions, Israeli government</a> officials and legislators are the first in line.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>'Jewish prayer rights'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>For some months now, this hard right coalition government has not just tolerated but actively supported a movement agitating for \"Jewish prayer rights\" at Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif - a sacred site to both Muslims and Jews. Members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's own Likud Party are a visible, vocal part of this campaign. There has been a tendency in some quarters to see the prayer issue as a kind of harmless coexistence campaign focused on equal rights. It is not. This movement goes against a long-established status quo agreement, whereby non-Muslims can visit, but not worship at this holy site housing both the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock.  </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>But more than that, it runs contrary to what Jewish religious leaders have been saying for centuries, which is to rule against Jewish prayer at Temple Mount. Today, there is only one, growingly influential rabbinical strain that says otherwise and that's the one guiding the religious-settler movement, which should make it abundantly clear that the issue is political, not religious. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>To play down the provocative nature of these attempts is either misinformed or disingenuous in the extreme. This is, after all, the same movement that talks openly about destroying the Dome of the Rock and replacing it with a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/minister-calls-for-third-temple-to-be-built/\" target=\"_blank\">third Jewish Temple</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Indeed, Israel's housing minister, Uri Ariel - yes, an active minister in the current cabinet - has said that he supports such a project. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>The issue is pushed by the same extremist settler strain that, aided, abetted and funded by the Israeli government, has been colonising swaths of East Jerusalem - the area that is internationally recognised as occupied, the area intended as the capital of a future Palestinian state. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>National-religious agenda</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>It isn't just Jewish neighbourhoods in the occupied east that are continually expanding; settlers have also taken properties in Palestinian neighbourhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah and non-Jewish parts of the Old City - throwing Palestinian families quite literally out onto the streets. And it is the same movement that - fully supported by the government and the mayor of Jerusalem - has commandeered crucial sites to push a narrow, national-religious agenda. One of these is the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/content/archaeology-used-politically-push-out-jerusalem-palestinians/7733\" target=\"_blank\">politically charged archaeological park at Silwan</a>, in the heart of the Holy Basin, where dozens of Palestinians have already been evicted.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span>So it doesn't matter how often Netanyahu says he isn't going to change the status quo at the holy sites; the actions of his own coalition create an entirely different impression. Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer specialising in Israeli-Palestinian relations in Jerusalem, explains that the accelerating, rightist-driven changes in the city have meant that Palestinians \"feel vulnerable and threatened - and they are not being paranoid. The anger is understandable and derives from serious sources\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But pushing this conflict into the religious realm, defining it as a \"religious war\", serves a clear political purpose. It means the Israeli government can bind its cause with the \"war on terror\", claiming that Palestinians are just like ISIL in their motivation - a hyper-violent, hyper-fundamentalist jihadi mission rather than a quest for self-determination. It deprives Palestinians of cause or motivation, save for just one factor: religious hatred. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>So in other words, never mind that the Palestinians in Jerusalem have lived under a punitive occupation for decades. Never mind that they are blatantly treated as second-class citizens, subjected to intense surveillance, harassment and arrests (<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.afp.com/en/news/knife-attacks-kill-two-israelis-unrest-spreads\" target=\"_blank\">900 in East Jerusalem since July</a>); that they routinely deal with settler violence, house demolitions, chants of \"Death to Arabs,\" and curtailed access to religious sites. Never mind the prevailing and overriding message that their lives count less than others. For if the horrifying spate of attacks in Jerusalem are exclusively about innate hatred for Jews - well, how can anything else even matter?  </span></p>\r\n<p>In this religious-hate reading lies a terrible danger: It implies that there is no way out and no solution; that the violence is inevitable. This is a narrative that dovetails perfectly with the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/02/20132102483880881.html\" target=\"_blank\">lines coming out of Israel's right-wing coalition</a> about how the conflict can only be \"<span>managed</span>\". Because if the issue is religious, then how could ending this thing we insist on calling an occupation, possibly help?</p>\r\n<p><span>But now more than ever, with religion so rampantly abused to weaponise increasingly brutal wars in the Middle East, the worst thing we could do is to frame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as religious. Now more than ever, only a just, political solution to this land- and rights-based conflict can save the holy capital from even more bloodshed and grief.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Rachel Shabi is a journalist and author of Not the Enemy: Israel's Jews from Arab Lands.</i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span>From the capture of Mosul by ISIL to the siege of Kobani, the political and media focus on what used to be called the Syrian civil war has changed. The battlefield has become more complex as the images have become ever more brutal.<br /> <br /> Yet one thing has not become more complex: the human suffering on the part of millions of Syrians fleeing their homes in fear of their lives, or stuck in them desperately trying to survive. It is vital that the new focus in the west on military options does not come at the expense of two humanitarian tragedies - one, inside Syria, continuing, and another, in the neighbouring countries, in the making.<br /> <br /> Inside Syria, fighting between the government of Bashar al-Assad and opposition forces is intensifying, exacerbating the dire humanitarian conditions already endured by its traumatised population. Relentless violence and insecurity hinder access to half of the 11 million people desperately in need of aid. The number trapped in besieged areas - a quarter of a million people in Damascene suburbs and Aleppo governorate - remains the same. As the UN Secretary-General put it last month, \"ordinary people are denied the basics required for their survival, food, healthcare, clean water… when assistance is available a short drive away\".<br /> <br /> In June, we called on members of the UN Security Council and key Middle Eastern states to appoint senior diplomats and politicians as humanitarian envoys, focused solely on securing help for those in need. Such top-level commitment is even more urgently necessary today than it was five months ago.<br /> <br /></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>The second, emerging tragedy is the increasing inability of Syria's neighbours to maintain the levels of hospitality they have extended to those fleeing the conflict over the past three and a half years. Since fighting broke out, the one escape route open to Syria's terrified (and typically multiply displaced) civilians has been across its borders and into Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey or Iraq. Together, these states have taken in more than three million Syrian refugees. Their governments have provided assistance to the most vulnerable and to the communities who host them, and have supported the efforts of NGOs to deliver vital services to those affected by the conflict. Their contribution makes them by some measures the biggest humanitarian donors to relief efforts in the region.<br /> <br /> But these four countries' economies, basic services and infrastructure can no longer cope. Syrian refugees now constitute a third of Lebanon's population. Jordan, one of the most water-starved nations on the planet, hosts more than 600,000 registered refugees, proportionally equivalent to the United States absorbing the population of the United Kingdom. The two countries have the highest per capita ratios of refugees worldwide, and their populations, along with those of Turkey and Iraq, are struggling to bear the growing burden - from overcrowding in schools and hospitals and spiralling living costs to stretched social fabric.<br /> <br /> Consequently, the four countries are taking measures to control the flow of refugees, targeting help on the most vulnerable. In 2013, the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, registered an average of 150,000 new Syrian refugees every month in the Levant. This year, the monthly average has dropped to 78,000, and in October - despite the increasing violence in Syria - the agency registered just 18,453. Thousands of traumatised civilians are now trapped on or near the country's borders: Fighting prevents their return home, or they have no homes to return to. Five months of heavy rain, snow and sub-zero temperatures lie ahead.<br /> <br /> This dangerous scenario is the result of a collective international failure to mobilise sufficient support for those countries whose proximity to Syria fates them to be beacons of hope for those desperate to get out. There are a number of steps that urgently need to be taken. Donors should work with Syria's neighbours to establish safe border crossing mechanisms for all those wishing to do so, regardless of their age, ethnicity, or political background. UNHCR's 2014 appeal for Syrian refugees - still only half-funded - must be supported.<br /> <br /> Syria's neighbours should receive the direct financial assistance they urgently require to plug the widening gaps in their basic services, repair their buckling infrastructure and create income-generating opportunities, to the benefit of both refugees and the communities that host them. Even if the conflict in Syria ended tomorrow it would take decades to rebuild the country; longer-term developmental support - allowing Syria's neighbours to rebuild and fortify their shaken economic and social infrastructure - will therefore be key.<br /> <br /> There is also another, symbolic but important, way in which those outside the Middle East can shoulder a fairer share of the burden. Less than two percent of the millions of Syrians sheltering in neighbouring countries are being offered resettlement outside the region. No state - with the exception of Germany - has allowed more than a token few to receive protection within its borders: The 18,453 registered by UNHCR last month is more than double the number the rest of the world has taken in through the agency's programmes since the Syrian conflict began. This constitutes a depressing collapse of international humanitarian solidarity, and can only lead to further destabilisation and misery in the region and beyond. UNHCR has set itself the target of securing the resettlement of 130,000 of the most vulnerable refugees by 2016. That is a beginning, and the world's wealthier countries should work to achieve it.<br /> <br /> As long as the violence inside Syria rages on and the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, those inside the country will keep trying to get out. The responsibility to shelter those fleeing lies with the whole world. Meeting it grows daily more urgent.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>David Miliband is the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee and was UK Foreign Secretary 2007-2010. </i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">International development is dying; people just don't buy it anymore. The West has been engaged in the project for more than six decades now, but the number of poor people in the world is <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/exposing-great-poverty-reductio-201481211590729809.html\" target=\"_blank\">growing</a>, not shrinking, and inequality between rich and poor continues to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/04/201349124135226392.html\" target=\"_blank\">widen</a> instead of narrow. People know this, and they are abandoning the official story of development in droves. They no longer believe that foreign aid is some kind of silver bullet, that donating to charities will solve anything, or that Bono and Bill Gates can save the world.</p>\r\n<p>This crisis of confidence has become so acute that the development community is scrambling to respond. The Gates Foundation recently spearheaded a process called the Narrative Project with some of the world's biggest NGOs - Oxfam, Save the Children, One, etc. - in a last-ditch attempt to turn the tide of defection. They commissioned research to figure out what people thought about development, and their findings revealed a sea change in public attitudes. People are no longer moved by depictions of the poor as pitiable, voiceless \"others\" who need to be rescued by heroic white people - a racist narrative that has lost all its former currency; rather, they have come to see poverty as a matter of <em>injustice</em>.</p>\r\n<p>These findings clearly demonstrate that people are beginning to reject the aid-centric approach to development. But instead of taking this as an opportunity to face up to their failures and change the way the industry works, the Gates Foundation and its partner NGOs have decided to stick with business as usual - but to cloak it with fresh language.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://therulesblog.org/the-narrative-project-judge-it-for-yourself/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Leaked internal documents</span></a><span> make it clear that the Narrative Project is nothing more than a PR campaign - a bid to \"change public attitudes\" by rolling out fresh language that will be more effective at securing public support and donations. The strategy goes like this: Talk about the poor as \"equals\" who share our values; emphasise that development is a \"partnership\"; stop casting rich people and celebrities as saviours of the poor; and above all, play up the idea of \"self-reliance\" and \"independence\", with special attention to empowering women and girls. Progressive Westerners love this stuff.</span></p>\r\n<p>This new framing amounts to little more than a propaganda strategy. Instead of changing their actual approach to development, the Narrative Project just wants to make people think they're changing it. In the end, the existing aid paradigm remains intact, and the real problems remain unaddressed.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>A failing project</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>Why do people no longer believe in the charity and aid-centric model of development? According to the Narrative Project, it's because they're all a bit stupid. They let their personal beliefs override the \"facts\". They're \"old\" and \"conservative\". And they're too calloused to care about social causes. It doesn't occur to the development industry that people might have good reasons for their scepticism. And there are many.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>For one, the aid project <em>is</em> in fact failing. There have been some achievements, to be sure, but the Gates Foundation and official sources like the UN want the public to believe that these piecemeal gains are tantamount to overall success. They tell us that poverty has been cut in half in the last fifteen years or so, but independent watchdogs have repeatedly shown that this claim rests on statistical </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.crop.org/viewfile.aspx?id=218\" target=\"_blank\"><span>sleight-of-hand</span></a><span>. Moreover, it relies on a poverty line of $1.25 a day, which </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/exposing-great-poverty-reductio-201481211590729809.html\" target=\"_blank\">no longer</a> </span><span>has any credibility. A more realistic line of $2.50 - the absolute </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.sarpn.org/documents/d0002130/\" target=\"_blank\">minimum</a> </span><span>for achieving normal human life expectancy - shows that 3.1bn people remain in poverty today, which is </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2010/01/21/000158349_20100121133109/Rendered/PDF/WPS4703.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">352m more</a> </span><em></em><span>people than in 1981, according to a 2008 study</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And all the while, the wealth ratio between the richest and poorest countries has </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-report-1999\" target=\"_blank\">grown</a> </span><span>from 44:1 in 1973 to nearly 80:1 today</span><span> (according to my estimation). The richest 85 people in the world (Mr Gates being one of them) now have </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/20/oxfam-85-richest-people-half-of-the-world\" target=\"_blank\"><span>more wealth</span></a><span> than the poorest 3.5 billion, or half the world's population.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The aid project is failing because it misses the point about poverty. It assumes that poverty is a natural phenomenon, disconnected from the rich world, and that poor people and countries just need a little bit of charity to help them out. People are smarter than that. They know that poverty is a feature of the global economic system that it is very often <em>caused</em> by people, including some of the people who run or profit from the aid agenda. People have become increasingly aware - particularly since the 2008 crash - that poverty is created by rules that rig the economy in the interests of the rich.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>A system of plunder</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>We can trace this rigging process through history. The programmes that global South countries used successfully to build their economies and reduce poverty after the end of colonialism - trade tariffs, subsidies, social spending on healthcare and education - were in many cases actively destroyed by Western intervention in the name of \"development\".  Western-backed coups in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Congo in 1961, Brazil in 1964, Indonesia in 1965, Chile in 1973 - to name just a few - deposed democratically elected leaders with pro-poor platforms to install dictators friendly to multinational corporations. Most of these dictators received billions of dollars in \"aid\" from Western governments.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>When coups fell out of favour with the voting public, the World Bank and the IMF stepped in instead. They leveraged debts to impose crushing \"structural adjustment\" programmes on poor countries, forcing them to privatise public assets, open their markets to Western goods, cut social spending and reduce wages, and give foreign companies access to extra cheap labour and raw materials. Structural adjustment was one of the greatest single causes of poverty in the global South in the 20th century, and it continues to this day under the guise of \"austerity\" .</span></p>\r\n<p><span>These destructive policies only persist because voting power in the World Bank and the IMF is controlled by rich countries. High-income countries control </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2010/04/art-566281/#_ftn1\" target=\"_blank\"><span>more than 60 percent</span></a><span> of the voting power at the World Bank, but are home to </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/income-level/OEC\" target=\"_blank\"><span>less than 15</span></a><span> percent</span><span> of the world's population.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Right now, developing countries lose as much as </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://iff.gfintegrity.org/iff2012/2012report.html\" target=\"_blank\">$900bn</a> </span><span>each year to tax evasion by multinational companies through trade mispricing, and almost </span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wkd0--M6p_oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=capitalism%27s+achilles+heel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MMrzU7fGPIWe0QWzqICgDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=capitalism's%20achilles%20heel&f=false\" target=\"_blank\"><span>the same sum again </span></a><span>through transfer pricing.

It is a state of plunder. It is delusional to believe that charity and aid are meaningful solutions to this kind of problem.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Some people in the NGO community know this all too well, and they are calling for genuine political change: The democratisation of the World Bank and the IMF, fairer trade rules, and an end to tax evasion. But because the leadership at the Gates Foundation and some NGOs find these issues inconvenient  such alternative voices are being side-lined in favour of a disingenuous attempt to \"fix\" public attitudes by pushing ever harder on the same old charity and aid story.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>If the Gates Foundation and NGO leadership want to get serious about tackling poverty, they might start by talking to the public about the importance of releasing developing countries from the siphons of rich countries and their corporations. They might help put the final nails in the coffin of the paternalistic story of charity and aid, white saviours and poor brown victims, and tell the real story about how the rich get richer off the backs of the poor. That would be a true starting point for development in the 21st century.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Dr Jason Hickel lectures at the London School of Economics and serves as an adviser to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.therules.org/\" target=\"_blank\">/The Rules</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span dir=\"ltr\">Martin Kirk, Global Campaigns Director of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.therules.org/\" target=\"_blank\">/The Rules</a>, contributed to the analysis for this article.</span></i></STRONG></em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><STRONG><i> </i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The conventional wisdom in Middle East diplomacy is that the question of Jerusalem is best left for last. Given its sensitivities, few dare tread into its complexities. Instead, the focus has often been on dealing with Gaza first. During the Oslo process, \"Gaza [and Jericho] first\" was the accepted beginning, and Ariel Sharon chose an exit out of Gaza as the means of creating a new political reality. Even former US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice was kept busy with Gaza, and in particular the Rafah crossing - a level of diplomatic resolution unusual for someone at her level. Gaza is a crucial issue that demands attention and resolution; however, as we are witnessing today, leaving Jerusalem aside is not without consequences.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/palestinians-suffer-israeli-settler-reprisals-20141118185543648426.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent violence </a>has been triggered by two factors. The first is the threat of changes to the status quo on the Haram Al Sharif or Temple Mount, the holiest site in the city for both Muslims and Jews. The new and rising demand by right wing Jewish religious groups to pray on the platform is eliciting much negative reaction by Palestinians. Given the deep distrust about Israeli intentions, changing the status quo on that site is perceived as a further encroachement of Israeli control over a Muslim site. The desire to pray may seem benign, but, as long as the conflict remains unresolved, it weaves dangerously into the fiery politics around the site.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The second factor has to do with the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/east-jerusalem-under-collective-punishment-2014111682924491709.html\" target=\"_blank\">status of Palestinian East Jerusalemites</a>. They compose one third of the population of the city, they have a special Israeli ID for \"residents of Jerusalem\", but they are not Israeli citizens, and they view the Israeli presence as an occupation, mostly rejecting any role in municipal politics. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Their status points to a larger problem. Arab Jerusalem was always naturally connected to its Palestinian hinterland until Israel built the wall around the city for security reasons, separating it from the West Bank. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">East Jerusalemites can still go to the West Bank, but the process is complicated and time consuming. More importantly, West Bankers need permits, acquired only with great difficulty, to enter Jerusalem. The natural social and economic linkages between the West Bank and Jerusalem have been broken.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Jewish identity</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Furthermore, over the last 10 years, East Jerusalem has undergone a slow but sure process of changes on the ground. From new Jewish settlements, to re-zoning of green space, to the renaming of street names, the Arab character and reality of the city is being slowly eroded in favour of Jewish identity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Some Israelis believed that the economic benefits that accrued to Arab Jerusalemites through their blue residents ID and links to Israel, would keep them peaceful. However, the changing status of the city and the holy sites, alongside neglect of Arab areas, has trumped this approach.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The power of religoius symbols and national identity, as well as the need for authentic, and not ersatz, autonomy has turned out to be more powerful. Time ran out, and Palestinian Jerusalemites rejoined their brethren in the West Bank and Gaza in fighting occupation in its many forms. Indeed, the nature of the Palestinian violence, from the use of a car as a weapon, to knives and axes demonstrates that, terrible as they may be, these reactions are neither well-armed nor organised. They are grassroots reactions to the realities that Palestinians are living. The challenge for Israel is homegrown; East Jerusalemites are free to move in the city, and, by Israeli choice, the Palestinian Authortity has no role in the city. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These factors, together, point to the heart of the problem. Many Israelis, and especially the right wing, have long stated that Jerusalem is their indivisible capital. However, this has translated into changes in the nature the city and now, critically, the holy sites. The very idea that Jerusalem - a city of complex meaning and deep symbolism to billions across the globe - should be controlled by one side may be simply unsustainable, and require examination.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Jerusalem is at the heart of Jewish history and faith, as it is for Christians and Muslims. The panoply of holy sites, especially in and around the Old City, mark these powerful connections, and many are angered when they cannot access them, or when their status appears to change. Israelis experienced these fears before 1967 and Palestinians do today; however, such concerns do not speak to unilateral control as the answer. Indeed, the deeply possesive, and sometimes aggressive, approach to these holy sites may be the very problem. It incorporates a denial and diminishing of the other that can hardly be called religious in any true sense. A lighter touch may provide greater possibility and stability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The demands on Jerusalem, today and in the future, are many: the capital of two states, Israel and Palestine, the management of holy sites and pligrimage for three monotheistic faiths, and a living city that needs a functioning municipality. There is no shortage of studies and answers to managing all these issues; what is lacking is the political will to effect change.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Need for third parties</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Given the international nature of the city, many of these solutions point to the need for third parties to play a role in the city. Whether through special arrangements or special regimes, this third party role will be necessary for the management of heritage and religious sites, as well as, potentially, for security matters. The <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/netanyahu-attend-crisis-meeting-amman-20141113151226470909.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jordanian role</a>, as stated in the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty, also cannot be ignored in this regard. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Indeed, the question of security control will be most difficult for Israelis to compromise over. However, it is also one of the most basic barometers of whether various groups have equal treatment and a sense of legitimacy. Today's reality leaves the doop open for further radical Israeli expansion. Unchecked, and lured by a potent mix of ideology and the holy sites, their actions have and will elicit an inevitable counter-reaction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/kerry-abbas-discuss-jerusalem-unrest-20141113141357916601.html\" target=\"_blank\"> John Kerry's intervention</a> demonstrated last week, talks on Jerusalem can no longer wait. This is not all bad news, the classic approach of leaving the city until last has left it vulnerable to the destructive desires of the most extreme. Practical and symbolic answers to Jerusalem may not only defuse current tensions, they may begin to unravel the very DNA of the conflict, the downward spiral around identity and possession, with positive ripples into the other areas of the conflict. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">No doubt, Gaza requires immediate redress because it is an isolated and besieged place destroyed by war. Unfortunately, it has also served as a tragic convenience to distract diplomats and decision-makers from other equally important matters.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Jerusalem can serve as the necessary counterpoint to Gaza, and it may be time to consider a new twin set to begin to heal the wounds, the place with the largest human and humanitarian problem alongside the locale with the most symbolic weight: Gaza and Jerusalem first. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Many policymakers across the planet don't dare to tread into this space, but leaving the wound in Jerusalem open is an act of irresponsibility by the international community.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The cost of doing nothing is now apparent for all to see.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">John Bell is Director of the Middle East Programme at the Toledo International Centre for Peace in Madrid.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The storm had been brewing for weeks. Desperate to<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/17/paris-skyscraper-triangle-tower-secret-ballot\" target=\"_blank\"> gain a majority over the the Triangle Tower</a>, the first skyscraper project in Paris for 41 years, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo had been working hard at promoting a project that most Parisians have rejected since the idea was launched in 2008.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">A dramatic vote on Monday at lunchtime was supposed to definitely kickstart - or bury once and for all - the controversial scheme. However, after a tight majority of 83 ballots to 78 voted against it, the vote was declared null and void by the mayor, on a technicality. Hidalgo has now appealed to the Justice to organise a new vote. Such confusion has fuelled even more heated debates and the hashtag #TourTriangle has been the top trend on French twitter since.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Although Hidalgo, a socialist, usually enjoys a majority in the city council, the topic of architecture in Paris is very divisive and fiery and politics don't always come into play. An unlikely alliance of Greens, Rightists, Centrists and Communists fought tooth and nail against the Triangle Tower.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Environmentally unsound</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The first to oppose the project as early as 2008 were the Greens who deemed it environmentally unsound. They argued that it was unsustainable on all accounts: costing a lot in energy, dedicated mostly to businesses and not to Parisians, and belonging to an already passe brand of gigantic glass buildings such as The Shard, the kind which fits better in Shanghai or London.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Confided to the distinguished world architects Jacques Herzog and Thierry de Meuron (responsible for the Beijing Stadium and the London Tate Modern's restructuration), \"Le Triangle\" was conceived as a 180-metre high tower (in comparison, the Eiffel Tower is 324-metres high and Montparnasse Tower just above 200 metres) with 90 percent of its space dedicated to offices and the rest to shops and a creche. Budgeted at around $625 million, it was to be financed by private investors. Hidalgo argued that 5,000 jobs were going to be created for its construction over a five-year period.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But such practical and pragmatic views are probably not the way to go about architecture in Paris. Of all people, Hidalgo should have known that Paris is a city like no other. You may be able to convince Londoners that another big tower in the City is a good thing for the economy, but not Parisians.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Paris, the most visited city in the world, with 31 million visitors a year (47 million for Greater Paris), is in many ways unique. One of the most densely inhabited cities in the western world, nearly on par with Calcutta, Paris also boasts the highest number of boutiques per inhabitants. And by shops, the Parisians usually mean bakeries, butchers, cheesemongers, patisseries, bookshops and all independent trading places, even though the ratio of franchises has skyrocketed in Paris in the last 10 years with Starbucks coffees and clothes shops replacing old artisan shops.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">City of Lights</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">If Paris still deserves today its epithet the \"City of Lights\", it is precisely because the light can freely flow into its streets and gardens, undisturbed by high-rise buildings such as Le Triangle. As a born and bred Parisian, who has lived almost half her life in London, I oppose skyscrapers projects such as Le Triangle in Paris (we already tried it, it is called La Defense) but I welcome audacious and innovative architecture to complement the beauty of Paris. And Paris is certainly not devoid of such architectural creativity.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Paris is not as conservative a city as one might think. If Baron Haussmann gave her its definite flavour in the 1870s, by piercing huge avenues (to enable the army quell rebellions) and setting the standard of the Parisian immeuble, which should not rise above Notre Dame's belfry, Paris has also changed little by little. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Over the last 70 years, Paris has proved both audacious and experimental, for better and for worse. Le Corbusier, for instance, wanted to completely erase the historical centre of Paris and build instead his favourite barres, or tower blocks. Luckily, he was not followed. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The ring road that encircles Paris, known as Le Peripherique, is now partly covered by gardens, which open up the capital to its banlieues. Whole new quartiers have emerged, for instance from the old docks in the 13th arrondissement. The new National Library was created on this sort of \"Left-South Bank\" and an immense new district of shops, businesses, institutions, universities, cinemas and residential homes have sprung up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">French presidents have also always been keen on leaving their prints on the French capital: Georges Pompidou was known for being a daring modernist and famously planned to destroy the Orsay Museum (then a train station) and luckily gave us the Pompidou Centre instead; Francois Mitterrand gave us the Louvre Pyramid, while Jacques Chirac commissioned the Branly Museum dedicated to African art. All great architectural successes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Parisians are not opposed to modernity, quite the opposite. They are simply more aware than most of posterity.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Agnes Poirier is the UK editor for the French political weekly MARIANNE, and a political commentator for the British, American, Canadian, French and Italian press, and a regular contributor to the BBC, Sky News, and Al Jazeera.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">It's a territory ruled by local warlords. It's a no man's land where private property can be confiscated on the whim of an armed group citing a shadowy martial law; where people get sentenced to death by dubious makeshift \"courts\"; and where women face punishment for alcohol consumption in public. It might be surprising to some that this place in fact is located in the continent of Europe.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The government in Kiev calls it \"temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories\", referring to the separatists' rule imposed on this land through the Russian invasion. The separatists themselves identify this land as two separate independent republics - Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The most devoted pro-Russian activists go as far as calling it \"Novorossiya\" (New Russia).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Whatever its supporters or opponents want to call it, this land stands for one thing only: a tragic political, socio-economic and humanitarian disaster. Its people are currently suffering a failed attempt to create some semblance of statehood which takes from the local population but does not give back.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Lawlessness and disorder</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Donetsk and Luhansk regions fell under the spell of separatism in the aftermath of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea declaring its independence from Ukraine back in March. The Crimean precedent encouraged the pro-Russian population in eastern parts of Ukraine to seek autonomy and closer ties with Russia by more violent means. In May, they had a self-rule referendum that Kiev denounced as illegal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Since then, tensions escalated and transformed into a lingering military confrontation, which has led to heavy losses on both sides - military and civilian. Currently the two regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, are under the control of different anti-Ukrainian paramilitary groups, which do not necessarily respond to a central command; this set-up undermines any attempt to preserve the rule of law and much less provide any services to the local population.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">There have been a few rather farcical attempts to demonstrate that there is normalised political life in these regions.

In particular, during a court session in Luhansk separatist commander Alexey Mozgovoy declared that women <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://tvrain.ru/articles/luganskim_devushkam_prigrozili_arestom_za_pohod_v_kafe_ili_klub-377629/\" target=\"_blank\">should not be allowed</a> to go to cafes or clubs, but should instead focus on preserving family values. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"If you want to stay faithful to your husband, stay at home and embroider,\" Mozgovoy was reported as saying at the session.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">A looming socio-economic crisis</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Six months after this senseless conflict started, DPR and LPR find themselves in a bizarre limbo with their patron Russia. On one side, the Kremlin is willing to supply weapons and risk the lives of its soldiers to help the separatists continue their resistance. On the other hand, it clearly has no intension either to absorb the two self-proclaimed republics, or to pay their bills.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The separatists were ironically forced to ask Kiev for help. The DPR and LPR governments issued a joint statement in which they called on the government in Kiev to keep paying pensions to \"innocent civilians\" and threatened to stop peace negotiations, if it doesn't. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">\"We are ready to supply Ukraine with coal so it could have a normal heating season. We need assistance with electricity, agriculture products, transportation, and export-oriented production,\" <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ostro.org/general/politics/news/457646/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the joint statement.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is hard for Ukraine's government to trust promises made by separatist leaders after they had repeatedly broken ceasefires and other agreements outlined in the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.osce.org/home/123257\" target=\"_blank\">Minsk protocol</a>. Thus the economic and social welfare of the separatist-controlled areas is not on Kiev's to-do list. So far the government has been paying pensions and social payments to DPR and LPR residents, but they had to travel to the closest cities under Ukrainian control to collect their payments. State-run institutions within the separatist regions were sporadically receiving some money, but this will change soon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">On November 5, Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=247727570&cat_id=244823857\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the government was suspending funding for social security and state institution payments to the temporarily occupied territories starting December 1. All social payments will be waiting for their beneficiaries and will be paid as soon as the area re-joins Ukraine. Gas and electricity supplies won't be cut off. How DPR and LPR will provide for their \"citizens\" during the winter remains to be seen.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This blend of absurdity and horror is not unique to Eastern Ukraine in post-Soviet times. Transnistria, the Republic of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have a lot in common with their Ukrainian counterparts DPR and LPR: All of them appeared as a result of a military conflict, they have not been recognised by most of UN member states but Russia's allies and all remain under Moscow's direct control. Yet if what is going in Eastern Ukraine is allowed to continue, the regions will succumb even further into chaos, insecurity and misery. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"color: #10131a; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Olesia Markovic is a Ukrainian journalist.  </span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">After 12 years of bitter accusations, threats of war, escalating sanctions, and interminable diplomacy, nuclear talks with Iran appear to be entering the final strait.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Last November, six world powers and Iran agreed a so-called Joint Plan of Action (JPOA). This committed Iran to freezing much of its nuclear activity - including the especially sensitive enrichment of uranium to 20 percent - in exchange for limited sanctions relief from the West. That deal expired on November 24. Although diplomats are free to keep talking after that date, the problem is that neither side will any longer be bound by these constraints. Iran will be free to resume higher-level enrichment, and the United States to impose fresh sanctions. Lawmakers and hawks in both capitals will agitate for their governments to do precisely this, even if Presidents Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani want more time. That would take us back to the confrontational and tense atmosphere of 2012 and 2013, where the spectre of military action cast a dark shadow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">While diplomats acknowledge that great progress has been made in the past year - more than in the previous decade put together - there reportedly remain crucial gaps, specifically over the amount of enrichment that Iran will be permitted to undertake, how long Iran will be bound by any restrictions, and the sequence of sanctions relief. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>An extension?</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Most therefore predict that negotiators will seek an extension of a few months, and perhaps even a \"framework agreement\" that pins down the areas of consensus. If this is the path chosen, they should know that they would face a rapidly closing window for dialogue, one that might snap shut by spring 2015 at the latest. Although Obama would theoretically be able to veto Congress' attempts at new sanctions, it is less clear whether Iran's Supreme Leader would give Rouhani the latitude to keep the nuclear programme frozen.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As for the content of a deal, the two sides are within touching distance. Consider one crucial aspect. Currently, Iran could produce enough fissile material for one nuclear bomb - although not the bomb itself - in less than two months, a scenario known as \"breakout\". The West wants to extend this to at least a year. As part of any deal, Russia seems <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21632564-russia-makes-big-move-endgame-negotiations-iran-will-it-help-or\" target=\"_blank\">likely to ship out Iran's stockpile</a> of enriched uranium to create fuel rods. This helps, but even if we assume Iran starts with no enriched uranium, it would still have to cut its number of first-generation centrifuges down to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/6874/kemp-setting-a-goal-for-iran-talks\" target=\"_blank\">just over 5,000</a> if the breakout time is to stretch to a year. Iran currently has 18,000 (8,000 are inactive, but this doesn't matter for these calculations). According to press reports, the highest reported US offer is 4,500 and the<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f99173eb2fc14d36a191b666491539c3/iran-talks-taking-stock-week-deadline\" target=\"_blank\"> lowest reported Iranian one is 8,000</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These details sound arcane, but the takeaway is simple: the devil really isn't in the detail. Even if we crudely split the difference, and assume a 6,000-centrifuge compromise, then we still end up with a 10-month breakout time. Iranian breakout would be detected within days, leaving ample time for a diplomatic and military response. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Israel's insistence that this would leave Iran at the \"nuclear threshold\" is simply not credible. And it is hard to understand why an extra two months would make much difference - and equally important to remember that an obsession with centrifuge numbers can come at the expense of attention to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/feature/who-cares-about-iranian-nuclear-breakout-beware-atomic-sneak-11604\" target=\"_blank\">covert routes to the bomb</a>, which can only be closed off through broad, intrusive inspections. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Politically toxic step</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The real challenge here is that Iran must commit to the politically toxic step of dismantling thousands of its machines, because merely disconnecting some piping, or locking them in a cupboard, doesn't really buy you much time. But even if we had allowed Iran to keep all its operating centrifuges, this problem would still have come up, given its plethora of inactive but installed machines. It's up to Iran whether it chooses to emphasise the dismantling, or the fact that it gets to keep thousands of centrifuges - this will shape whether it can sell a deal at home.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Centrifuges aside, the issue of sanctions relief is proving to be particularly thorny. The US is offering the release of blocked funds and temporary sanctions waivers, with more permanent sanctions relief - requiring the approval of an intransigent Congress - further down the line. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Iran is understandably wary of limited and reversible measures, not least because the economic benefits are one of its primary motives for negotiating a deal in the first place. But assuming that these and other differences are bridged, what will be its regional implications?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A deal is <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/11/us-new-friend-region-iran-20141191344125636.html\" target=\"_blank\">not the same thing as rapprochement</a>. The US' regional allies - Gulf states, Israel, and Turkey - all fear that a deal might prompt further US-Iran alignment at their expense. A letter from Obama to Ayatollah Khamenei, reportedly implying that a deal would enable cooperation against ISIL, as well as <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://m.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/16/remarks-president-obama-g20-press-conference-november-16-2014\" target=\"_blank\">Obama's explicit admission</a> that he wants a \"political conversation\" on Syria to include Iran. Last month, the US envoy to the anti-ISIL coalition acknowledged that \"we have welcomed Iran's constructive role in Iraq\", and \"we are going to continue to listen very carefully to the things they have to say\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">At the same time, Obama knows that sudden, overt collaboration with Iran would cause Arab allies to peel away from his military coalition in Syria, and complicate efforts to stand up armed Sunni forces in ISIL-afflicted parts of Iraq. Moreover, any meaningful US-Iran dialogue is premised on the US talking directly to Iran's Revolutionary Guards, who oversee Iran's extensive interventions in Syria and Iraq, or the Supreme Leader handing over the portfolio to Iran's more pragmatic foreign ministry. Neither scenario seems especially likely, and so the idea of US-Iran cooperation - whether one fears of welcomes it - is likely to outstrip the reality, in the months after any deal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The reverse, however, is more worrying: if diplomacy collapses, the negotiating window slides shut, and Iran's nuclear programme starts re-expanding, the prospect of an Israeli or US war comes back into the picture, except this time both Tehran and Washington are already committed to open-ended campaigns, on multiple fronts, and, in Iraq, against the same adversary. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Shashank Joshi is a research fellow of the Royal United Services Institute in London and a PhD candidate at Harvard University.

Many Serbians, even those who do not lean right, see him as someone who came home a winner, as the man who brought the Tribunal down to its knees. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>And as officials in The Hague contemplate the future of the ICTY, Serbia will have to deal with <span>the resurrection of Seselj which</span> threatens to stir simmering tensions within a society tired of endless transition. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><STRONG><i>Seselj's revenge</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>Back in 2003, current Serbian <span>President Tomislav Nikolic and </span>Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic saw off Seselj on his way to The Hague with tears. B<span>ack in the 1990s t</span>hey were both close associates of Seselj - the number two and number three in the Serbian Radical Party, one of the largest political parties in Serbia at that time. When Seselj went to the ICTY, Nikolic assumed the leadership of the party.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>As members of parliament, Nikolic and Vucic wore Seselj's image pinned on their lapels, promoted his ideas of a Greater Serbia and declared all steps taken by Serbia towards Euro-Atlantic integration betrayal.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>In 2008, the two of them, along with 20 other radicals, abandoned the ultranationalist cause. They formed the new Serbian Progressive Party and made an ideological u-turn. Their party now supports cooperation with the US, rapprochement with Western Europe, and EU accession. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>But unlike other countries from the region which negotiated their way into the EU, Serbia's accession path is complicated by tough demands from the EU, including normalisation of relations with Kosovo, and renunciation of Serbia's \"neutral foreign policy\" on the Ukraine issue and introduction of sanctions towards Russia. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>The Serbian government conceeded to signing an agreement on the normalisation of relations with Kosovo which was negotiated and signed in Brussels under the auspices of the EU. This move was not well-received by nationalists.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\">One of the first statements Seselj made after stepping on Serbian soil was that he is now seeking \"revenge\" against all those who had betrayed him - an uncanny reference to Vucic and Nikolic. He went on to call for establishing a close alliance with Russia (even suggesting what he called \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://web-tribune.com/tema_dana/seseljev-intervju-za-glas-rusije-nasa-sansa-i-jedini-spas-je-potpuna-integracija-sa-rusijom#\" target=\"_blank\">integration</a>\") and abandoning the negotiations for accession to the EU and any cooperation with western countries</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">During the welcoming rally for Seselj in the centre of Belgrade, the media, under the influence of the ruling party, only took pictures of older, unkempt and bearded ultranationalists who looked like extras from an old movie. The media tried to ignore the presence of young men and women who were only children when Seselj went to The Hague.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>These young people might not remember the politics of the 1990s, but they are disappointed and bitter about their lives in the 2010s. They cannot see a tangible benefit from Serbia's re-orientation towards Europe and Nato. They are young, angry and in need of a charismatic figure to worship. Seselj could be the catalyst to ignite their discontent and lead them to become a strong factor in Serbian politics. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>We no longer have citizens in Serbia, Ratko Bozovic, a sociologist and professor tells me; we have only \"partocrats\". People go from one party to another without paying any attention to ideas; they just go with those in power. With the reduction in salaries and retirement compensations </span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">which will take place before Christmas, there will be further citizenship attrition. Bozovic says that if Seselj's health does not fail him, he is well-positioned to win many more followers for the ultra-right cause in Serbia.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>Vucic and Nikolic are well aware that they have limited space for manoeuvre in complying with western demands.  In the weeks leading up to Seselj's return, Belgrade hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin for a short visit, welcoming him with a military parade and decorating him with the Order of the Republic of Serbia. While Seselj was welcomed at the airport, Russian and Serbian troops conducted a joint military exercises in the north of Serbia. Clearly, Vucic and Nikolic cannot risk giving Seselj more political capital for his revenge. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>Were it not for this geostrategic labyrinth and an EU accession process made too slow and difficult, Seselj's return to the immature political scene in Serbia would have not created so much confusion. Had The Hague Tribunal efficiently and impartially done its job and justly sentenced or acquit those suspected of war crimes, Seselj and his rhetoric would have been forgotten. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><span>With the current geopolitical circumstances, Seselj's presence on Serbian soil will only create more tension and instability and will be a constant reminder of our war-torn past.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv1210111920msonormal\"><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><STRONG><i>Zorana Suvakovic is a Belgrade-based journalist, columnist and editor, working for the Serbian newspaper Politika.</i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On November 16, Vladimir Putin decided to abruptly leave the G20 Summit in Brisbane, underlining the deepening of the rift between Russia and other world powers. The contrast with recent joint celebrations of World War II armistice gathering Putin and western heads of state, or with Gorbachev's presence at the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall last week, is striking. The confrontation between a liberal Europe and a centralised Russia once torn to pieces 25 years ago seems to have reached a new level. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Indeed, at the very same time commemorations of the fall of the Berlin wall <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">peaked </span>last week, the rumbling of military boots continued to shed a troubling light over the civil conflict in Ukraine. Even after the signing of the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russias-putin-ukraines-poroshenko-end-summit-with-no-breakthrough-on-conflict/2014/10/17/f12d55c8-5604-11e4-b86d-184ac281388d_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Minsk ceasefire protocol</a> last September, fighting never totally stopped in Donetsk and the number of casualties in fights between local military groups supported by the former Cold War foes kept rising. While in Berlin, some rejoiced over the end of the Cold War last century, others in Mariupol, Luhansk or Kiev fear its return today.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On the one hand, Putin is able to make a convincing case that Crimea and the Eastern Ukrainian Republics should be <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/17/vladimir-putin-denies-russian-forces-eastern-ukraine-kiev\" target=\"_blank\">attached to Russia on historical grounds</a>, often referring to \"Novorossiya\", the 19th century denomination of a Russian Tsar-controlled territory that spread beyond Odessa in Ukraine.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Russian sovereignty</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, the very same logic can be used to challenge the Russian sovereignty over territories in the Pacific and Europe, from the Japanese claimed Kuril Islands to western Karelia, which most in Finland claim has been illegally occupied by Russia since 1939. The same argumentation fuels a decades long dispute with China over the north bank of Russia's Far Eastern Amur River.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Last week's events have not been followed more closely than in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave within Europe, a narrow piece of land between Poland and Lithuania, where this contradiction is felt every day. This small territory, home to half a million inhabitants, has for centuries been under Prussian and later German control before being seized by Stalin in the last months of World War II. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Before its takeover by Russia, Koenigsberg - as it was then called - was an important industrial and trade asset for Germany but also an essential German intellectual and cultural centre, known for being the birthplace of Immanuel Kant and the residence of Hannah Arendt and poets such as Simon Dach and Agnes Miegel. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Putin can hardly argue that the Russian sovereignty over Kaliningrad/Koenigsberg is naturally derived from cultural and historical legitimacy. Immanuel Kant is one of the main father figures of the very European liberalism that Moscow rejects today. The political philosophy Kant theorised is based on two main principles: a republican government and a liberal participation in international organisation, which both are antithetic to Putin's administration and strategy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Interestingly, Kaliningrad is home today to a large Ukrainian community, the descendants of populations from Kiev or Donetsk encouraged to settle in the oblast under Stalin after the Germans were expelled. Despite constant attempts to silence the territories' cultural traditions, the permanence of Prussian ruins next to the Soviet-inspired architecture and the vicinity of European countries have led to the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/if-russia-gets-crimea-should-germany-get-kaliningrad/496558.html\" target=\"_blank\">creation a mixed society</a>, both russophone and proud of its heritage as the former Prussian capital in the 1500s and 1600s. In the dispute over the denomination of the territory (Kaliningrad or Koenigsberg), its inhabitant have opted either for \"Konig\" or \"Kant'grad\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Direct consequences</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The current turmoil between Europe and Russia has had direct consequences for Kant'grad. An agreement signed in 2012 which allowed the inhabitants to cross into Poland for their daily groceries or consumption goods purchases without visa could be affected by the ramping up of European sanctions.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Similarly, the territory has become very vulnerable following the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://rbth.com/business/2014/09/04/vulnerable_kaliningrad_finding_its_way_past_food_embargo_despite_pro_39561.html\" target=\"_blank\">food embargo </a>imposed by Putin in August. The population now fears an increase in prices for daily commodities - and ongoing tensions in Ukraine and the isolation of Russia internationally should not alleviate their worries.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To compensate for the rising concerns over unemployment and inflation, the Kremlin opened its wallet despite its own economic turmoil. To break with the isolation, the Kremlin announced the construction of a $224 million port infrastructure in the seaport of Kaliningrad. Economic incentives and support from Moscow fall short however. In an essay <a href=\"http://www.stoletie.ru/rossiya_i_mir/krym_prishol_a_kaliningrad_uhodit_799.htm\" target=\"_blank\">published in Stoleti.ru</a>, Vladimir Shulgin, a professor at the Baltic Federal University underlined the slow drift of Kaliningrad away from Russian nationalism and towards a more liberal and European identity. This tribune led to his expulsion from a university in which he had worked over 30 years. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet the slow increase of support to nationalist movements in Kaliningrad cannot be denied. If the strength of separatist movements in Kaliningrad is often exaggerated and their structuration weak, some parties do gain traction such as the Baltic Republican Party.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As Vladimir Titov - a Moscow based commentator - argues, \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://rufabula.com/articles/2014/08/13/from-siberia-to-the-amber-country\" target=\"_blank\">regionalism as a political direction has real prospects</a>\" in Kaliningrad, which clearly diverges from the centralisation of power in Moscow. While the Kremlin was very swift and determined to regain control over Crimea (and the Russian Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol), it will eventually have to face the growing discontentment and normative drift of its population in a faraway exclave, home to its Baltic Fleet. And this time the historical legitimacy will work against him.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Remi Piet is Assistant Professor of Public Policy, Diplomacy and International Political Economy at Qatar University.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Yemen is burning. However, with bigger fires getting out of control in other parts of the world, it seems to have been relegated to the back page of mainstream media for most of the last few months. But what happens there in the near term and long term really does matter, both locally and regionally. The poorest country in the Middle East, Yemen has been plagued for decades by corrupt and weak governments, tribal infighting, resource depletion, a deteriorating security situation and utter poverty. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Two months ago, Houthi rebels riding a wave of public discontent, swarmed into the capital city of Sanaa from the north, and succeeded in bringing the regime to its knees in a matter of just days. In the eyes of many Yemenis, the Houthis are, at least for now, the dominant political force and best hope for change in a country that truly needs it from top to bottom. They are also a substantial military force, having taken control of much of Yemen's security apparatus in the north and central parts of the country. What makes both these points remarkable is that the Houthis are members of the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam, a small minority in an otherwise Sunni majority country. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Zaidis reigned over much of northern Yemen under a system of religious and secular rule known as an imamate for over a thousand years until revolution swept through the country in 1962. Yemen's nationalist movement eventually led to the establishment of two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen and the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen. In 1990, North and South Yemen united to become the present day Republic of Yemen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Marginalised</i></STRONG> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">However, the Zaidis never regained the power and influence they had prior to 1962, and have been both politically and economically marginalised by each successive government ever since - at least up until now. And that's an important point to remember in any discussion about the Houthis.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In 2004, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423\" target=\"_blank\">Hussein Badr al Din al-Houthi</a>, a dissident cleric from northern Yemen and head of the Zaidi sect there, started an uprising against the government in Sanaa, demanding greater autonomy in the north, as well as to protect Zaidi religious and cultural traditions from perceived impingement by Sunnis. Houthi was killed by government troops just a few months later, but his followers adopted his name and carried on the struggle. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Following a series of on again off again periods of bloody fighting, the Houthis agreed to a ceasefire with the government in 2010. However, not much changed for the Houthis in terms of perceived grievances perpetuated by the government, which brings us to the more recent events that resulted in the Houthis' rapid and astonishing rise to power. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">President Ali Abdullah Saleh ruled Yemen with an iron fist for more than 30 years, and although a Zaidi himself, was no ally of the Houthis. In fact, he was their nemesis during and after the six years of rebellion.   As the Arab Spring swept through much of the Middle East in 2011, the Houthis took advantage of growing dissatisfaction throughout Yemen with the Saleh government, and began to consolidate their control in the north. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">As part of the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://carnegieendowment.org/syriaincrisis/?fa=57091\" target=\"_blank\">Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative</a> signed later that year, Saleh agreed to step down and pass the reigns of power to his deputy, Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But once again, promises of government reform went nowhere and the lives of everyday Yemenis, to include the Houthis, were no better. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For the Houthis, the final straw in their clash with the government was the lifting of fuel subsidies in July 2014, which lead to wide scale protests by both Sunni and Shia in Sanaa. By that time, the Houthis had become much more politically astute and militarily capable. They knew what they wanted and how they were going to achieve it. After taking control of Sanaa in September, the Houthis forced Yemen's Prime Minister, Mohammed Basindwa, to resign, and then outright rejected Hadi's first nomination to replace him. From that point on, the Houthis have more or less been calling the shots in Sanaa, although it's important to note that what happens there doesn't necessarily carry weight in much of the rest of the country. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Political concessions</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">So what do the Houthis want? The short answer is political concessions that give them significant influence in the central government and greater regional autonomy throughout the country, particularly for them in the north. And so far, they've been very successful in that regard. Since taking control of security functions in and around Sana’a two months ago, the Houthis have proven to be a formidable military force, and have not shied away from flexing their muscle.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Frustrated with Hadi's slow pace toward reform, the Houthis gave him a 10-day ultimatum at the end of October to form a new government, which he subsequently announced on November 9. The new technocratic reconciliation government includes representatives from the traditional power bases as well as the Houthis, southern secessionists and most every other political party in the country. For now, the Houthis have established themselves as a legitimate political party with long-term goals, and an essential part of the security apparatus. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">So what stands in the way of the Houthis' plans for greater influence in Yemeni politics? Plenty. In the south, the al-Hirak secessionist movement looks at the Houthis as a direct threat to their long sought after aim of independence, especially if the Houthis begin to move in that direction. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Consider also, the Islah Party, which is Yemen's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Houthis' biggest political rival. Each will do what they can to undermine the other. And then of course there is al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), based primarily in central Yemen, where the Houthis have already begun to extend their influence. Daily clashes between the Houthis and AQAP are taking a deadly toll on both sides, with no sign of letting up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">AQAP will forge whatever relations they can with the Sunni tribes in central Yemen to exploit in their favor the Sunni-Shia struggles seen throughout much of the Middle East. And speaking of Sunni-Shia struggles, don't discount Saudi Arabia either, which looks at the Houthis as nothing more than an Iranian tool to undermine them. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Houthis' rise to power and influence was as sudden as it was unexpected, and for now at least, they have brought about political change that may not have occurred otherwise for many years. Change that for the first time in Yemen's history is set to be truly representative of all the disparate political factions. Only time will tell whether the new government can effectively control a country as complex and diverse as Yemen. But the Houthis' best chance at helping it to succeed is to maintain their role as a legitimate long-term political party with limited goals and a short-term guarantor of security. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">What they don't want to do is become another divisive political or military element with a grand scheme for power and influence, something Yemen has proven to have no shortage of in the past. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Martin Reardon is a Senior Vice President with The Soufan Group, a New York-based strategic security and intelligence consultancy, and Senior Director of Qatar International Academy for Security Studies.

The legal framework, along with the international community's support for equal rights, has allowed Afghan women to make big strides during the past decade.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Still, women who symbolically take government offices or parliament seats and do not stir trouble might be tolerated. But the likes of Barakzai, who are active and outspoken in political, social and cultural arenas, are thought to have crossed the line. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The attack on Barakzai's car was clearly meant as a warning to other Afghan women to mind the limits that the Taliban ideology imposes on Muslim women, regardless of the rights the Holy Quran bestows upon them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This view is not limited to the Taliban and other armed groups fighting the Afghan government and its international supporters. There are a few conservative elements within the system, who reap the benefits of democracy and international aid, while sharing the Taliban's view that women have no place in the public sphere. They make up a small contingent, but thanks to the support they have enjoyed from the previous administration as well as the international community's hitherto acquiescence, their voices are loud. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Bilateral Security Agreement</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There are also rumours that the attack followed a series of threats that Barakzai and other women MPs had received last week, as they were seeking to gather signatures for the approval of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between Afghanistan and the US - still pending approval from the parliament.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai had refused to sign the security pact, perhaps hoping to gain favours in certain \"moderate\" Taliban quarters and with their Pakistani supporters. The new Afghan administration signed it immediately, arguing that in the negotiations process, the most important Afghan concerns were raised and met favourably by the Americans.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">More importantly, the ratification of the BSA, as Ghani has argued time and again, would, for the first time since the US military intervention of 2001, return Afghan national sovereignty to the Afghan state. In the past 13 years, the presence of US and NATO forces on Afghan soil was legally justified through UN Security Council resolutions. The bilateral agreement would recognise the state of Afghanistan as the legitimate counterpart and decision-maker on the presence of US troops in the country.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Some MPs have raised objections to granting judicial immunity to US troops and want to see an end to the night raids and house searches. The US military's Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act binds Washington to insist on the judicial protection of its military personnel abroad. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When upon Karzai's insistence, night raids were somewhat curtailed, the country witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks. Therefore, the majority of Afghans today favour night raids as a means to maintaining security in the country.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Whether there is any truth to the rumours linking BSA naysayers to the attempt on Barakzai's life, or if the incident was a part of the larger assault on women's rights and progress, surely targeting women politicians in Afghanistan is a relatively new phenomenon. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Helena Malikyar is an Afghan political analyst and historian.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For the first time in the pre-season, I came late to junior varsity basketball practice. I had made the team at 336 pounds, during my junior year in high school, even though all of my classmates were playing varsity, I was just happy to make the team. That day Coach Slappy looked at me as I entered the gym, and without giving me the chance to explain my tardiness, he put his index finger up and circled it in the air, directing me to run laps. I was ok with the punishment for the tardiness, but what I wasn't ok with was his insistence on the \"finger-circling\" when I asked and continued asking as I ran, \"how many laps, coach?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">That day I felt as though I had received the worst punishment of my life. I could have run a 100 laps that day had he let me know how many laps I needed to run, but the psychological punishment was, for me, nothing short of torture. That day, I ran 29 laps around the basketball court, but every lap felt like the last one. By the time Coach Slappy remembered to tell me to stop, I was mentally and physically drained.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> I remembered this story on my 27th birthday - my second in prison - as I finished 290 days on hunger strike. It's exactly 10 years later, and I am 150 pounds lighter. I am sitting in an underground Egyptian dungeon reflecting on that basketball season and its relevance to my current circumstances. I have lost the sense of hunger, I lose consciousness often, I wake up to bruises and a bloody mouth almost daily and physical pain has become the norm. My body has become numb as it eats away at itself.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Psychological torture</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But none of that is as painful as the psychological torture that the ambiguity of the detainment (under an indefinite temporary holding law) is imposing. This dark and gloomy nightmare that I have no clue how it descended on me so suddenly, how long it will last, how and when it will end. A much more extreme feeling than that of Coach Slappy's punishment, yet similar; mental and physical depletion. I do not know how long until this \"punishment\" ends, so every day passes like it is the last, slow and excruciating.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">And just when the rare tears filled up my eyes as I go down memory lane to that basketball season, it all began to come together. That year I stopped smoking sheesha, lost 60 pounds, worked extra hard every practice, and moved from benching the junior varsity team to sixth-man, to a starter. By the end of the year, I was on the varsity basketball team with my classmates.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> I realised that that one day, Coach Slappy decided to punish me, he wanted to test my mental strength, my potential, and whether I had enough heart for the game. He kept this up the rest of season, and I was certainly transforming into a better basketball player. My mental strength would be cultivated through these tests because I trusted he was making me a better player.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Weakness and inability</span></i></STRONG><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> I could not help the tears flowing down my cheeks as I thought of my weakness and inability to fully trust God's wisdom as I did with Coach Slappy. There was no comparison of course; This test is much more extreme and definitely more painful, but just like the former made me stronger, this was also going to make me stronger. Just like I was prepped to be a better basketball player, I was being molded by God to be a wiser human, an effective leader, and a stronger advocate of freedom and peace. My coach's words - \"Hate every moment of training but love and cherish every second of victory\" - are ever-so relevant.</span><br /> <br /><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> A ray of optimism lit my heart. That's the thing about birthdays, anniversaries, new years, etc. They inspire reflections of the past, thoughts and emotions around purpose, priorities, plans, future and hope. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">I wiped my tears and just as I began to prepare for night prayer to thank God for all His blessings, I smiled as I remembered what I told myself 10 years ago during the 29th lap... This has an end.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Mohamed Soltan is an Egyptian-American political activist who was arrested by Egyptian security forces on August 25, 2013.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">What are G20 summits if not talking shops for world leaders who usually get together, at huge cost for taxpayers, and produce a bland joint statement that contains promises which are rarely met? In fact, if you look back at these summits, you would notice that hacks usually struggle to report anything of substance in the first couple of days, banging on about \"unprecedented levels of security\" and \"angry protesters\" demanding that world leaders listen to their concerns. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">But the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, proved to be a different sort of occasion for both the scribblers and talking heads. It had suspense and rumours of stand-offs from the word go.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The world was treated to a production called \"West gives President Vladimir Putin a piece of its mind over Russia's role in Ukraine\". There were some outstanding performances by some world leaders, who used the opportunity to flex their diplomatic muscles, show what they were made of and talk the talk and even walk the walk. Especially as it so happened that several days before the summit reports had emerged that \"Russian tanks and heavy artillery\" had crossed the border into Ukraine and all the usual suspects in Kiev and beyond made all the usual noises about Moscow \"escalating the crisis in eastern Ukraine\". </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Posturing and chest-beating</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The stage was therefore set for some serious posturing and chest-beating in Brisbane, sparing hacks the humiliating task of tracking down some odd looking anti-globalists for an interview or filming stern-faced cops, looking into the distance purposefully, representing the \"unprecedented levels of security\". </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">In fact, the excitement had started even before the summit opened, with British Prime Minister David Cameron addressing journalists at a joint press conference with the host, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Both pointed to the dangers of ignoring the lessons of history and letting a big country bully smaller ones. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Hacks added a bit of drama to his words and - presto! - we had headlines saying that Cameron had \"compared Russia to Nazi Germany\", with some especially excited journos even saying that he had \"likened Putin to Hitler\".   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Then finally the Russian president arrived and the drama went into overdrive, with the poor \"angry protesters\" struggling to get noticed. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who usually gets overlooked at the G20 and G8 summits, was thrown into the spotlight on this occasion by supposedly telling Putin during their handshake to \"get out of Ukraine!\" At least that was how it happened according to Harper's aides; my own Russian sources told me that it was actually much more cordial than that, with Putin replying that there were no Russian troops in Ukraine and there was nothing to discuss. But hey, the drama still played out well in TV news bulletins, on the news wires and in news print. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">There were other cases of muscle flexing and posturing, with US President Barack Obama warning Putin that he risked further isolation if he didn't change his ways in Ukraine and rumours surfacing that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was hinting that more sanctions against Russia could follow. Cameron also had a chance to demonstrate that he was not to be taken lightly, giving Putin a handshake with attitude, before holding a one-on-one meeting with him. French President Francois Hollande had his stern expression on when he came to meet with Putin. The joke among the Russian journos accompanying Putin was that western leaders were all jealous of Putin's 88 per cent popularity rating - domestically. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Something to write about</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Hacks were over the moon with all that excitement, thanking their lucky stars that they had something to write about for once from a G20 summit. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The climax of the summit came when it was reported that Putin would be leaving Brisbane earlier than others, supposedly \"upset\" by all that criticism levelled at him. That gave more ammo to the hungry pack of reporters, keeping them guessing what Putin's real game was. The Russian president himself said that he had to leave earlier, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/11/putin-walks-out-g20-summit-early-201411164322920220.html\" target=\"_blank\">to catch some sleep and be at his desk in the Kremlin</a> first thing in the morning the next day. Few people bought that but the overall conclusion was that Putin was not going to lose any sleep over what he had heard in Brisbane from his western counterparts concerning Ukraine and that the issue was not going away any time soon.       </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">And it was then that reality of another G20 summit kicked in and the media had to deal with a rather boring document that lacked any serious meat on its bones. For example, it stated that the G20 nations would increase their GDP by an additional 2 per cent by the year 2018, but contained no suggestions on how exactly it would be achieved. It also talked about job growth and an increase in investment, but again in very vague terms. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The really exciting parts, according to some hacks, were the mention of climate and Ebola in the document but no deadlines or specific amounts of money were given so it was unclear how this would work. Sharing information on tax evasion was the only point that got some people going, but the lack of any commitment to make that information public took off a lot of the gloss from the proposal. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Hardly value for money for the $800 million spent on this summit. Still, at least there was a bit of drama for a change. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Alexander Nekrassov is a former Kremlin and government adviser.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

The designations were announced on the state's official news agency on November 15, marking a nefarious precedent where a government of a Muslim-majority state has designated a Muslim-American institution as a \"terrorist organisation\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">While the classification of both organisations as terrorist groups is alarming, the allegation against CAIR is particularly concerning. The advocacy organisation based out of Washington, DC, which encompasses 28 chapters across the United States, has stood as a vital and vocal opponent of state-sponsored discrimination against Muslim-Americans. In addition, CAIR - principally through its chapters - has carried forward unapologetic initiatives aimed at eroding Islamophobia and defending Muslim-American individuals and institutions during the post-9/11 era.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Regional politics, not CAIR's work stateside, moved the UAE to designate the civil rights organisation a terrorist group. More specifically, hearsay tying CAIR with the Muslim Brotherhood, a political nemesis of the UAE, is believed to be the principal catalyst behind the designation.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Although distant geopolitical concerns are behind the UAE designating CAIR as a terrorist organisation, what impact will the classification have on the advocacy group, its civil rights mission, and collaterally, Muslim-Americans at large? The ramifications are not only acute, but also extensive.       </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">A widening 'gulf'</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Centuries old stereotypes, still embedded in the American imagination, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"https://annualsurveryofamericanlaw.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/69-1_beydoun.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">conflate Muslims</a> - regardless of their nationality or locale - as one and the same. Therefore, Muslim Americans - the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection to the UAE - are consistently lumped up with the prevailing stereotypes attributed to the people of the oil-rich state: endless wealth, modern slavery, and conspicuous expression of religious conservativism cloaking commercial insatiability.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, the differences between Muslims in monarchical Gulf States and Muslim-America are as ample, and extensive, as the differences between Dubai and Detroit - their respective hubs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The recent designation of CAIR as a terrorist organisation not only provides further evidence that Muslims are anything but a monolith, but also manifests a widening political and interests' gulf between Muslims in the UAE and Muslim-Americans.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Since 9/11, the UAE has expressed only passing concern for the civil liberties crackdown experienced by Muslim-Americans. This apathy may be a surprise to everyone in the US aside from Muslim-Americans, who can point to the dehumanisation of Muslim migrant workers within the Gulf region to highlight how religious affinity is seldom a source of apathy.    <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With heightening state and societal animosity toward Islam in the US, particularly with the recent emergence of ISIL, the UAE's designation of CAIR as \"terrorists\" shifts their state stance from apathy toward full-fledged assault. The designation has two considerable effects: first, it endorses specific allegations from right-wing US groups that <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/13/rahat-husain-fox-silences-muslim-challenges-condem/\" target=\"_blank\">CAIR colludes with terrorist networks</a>; and second, functions as testimony, from a native state informant, deepening the stereotype that critical Muslim-American civil rights organisations are subversive and anti-American. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Abetting Islamophobia</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">CAIR is not designated a terrorist group within the US. However, the organisation and its leadership have fended off<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/15/united-arab-emirates-designates-two-american-muslim-groups-as-terrorist-orgs/\" target=\"_blank\"> allegations of direct or indirect links</a> with state-designated terrorist groups for many years. The allegations, although legally tenuous, curried public perception that CAIR itself had terrorist affiliations. This led to increased government surveillance of its Executive Director, Nihad Awad, FBI probing of CAIR chapters and community outreach work, monitoring of Muslim-Americans seeking their counsel, and intensified slander from right-wing political leaders and media pundits.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">By classifying CAIR as a terrorist organisation, among the likes of ISIL, al-Qaeda, and Boko Haram, the move will embolden Islamophobic elements to pronounce their hateful rhetoric, and expedite draconian policies against Muslim-Americans.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Hussam Ayloush, Executive Director of CAIR's Greater Los Angeles chapter, echoes that the designation will \"fuel Islamophobia, and undermine the safety and well being of Muslim communities [in the United States] around the world\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Furthermore, the UAE designation will further complicate CAIR's ability to carry forward advocacy work protecting Muslim-Americans. Instead of marshaling manpower and resources to handling hate crimes cases, public workshops, and other direly needed initiatives, the designation will compel the organisation and its staff to respond to its placement on the terrorist list, and collaterally, deal with the barrage of political and private hate that is sure to follow. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Without question, the designation not only undermines the interests of CAIR, but also the nearly 8 million Muslim-Americans that benefit from its work. Among the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/muslim-americans-presumed-guilt-201492981346604671.html\" target=\"_blank\">most marginalised and maligned communities</a> in the US, the Muslim-American plight is compounded by a dearth of effective and unapologetic advocacy groups.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Therefore, formal condemnation of their most prominent defender will trickle down to hold them vicariously liable of \"terrorism\", a perspective already widely held in the US. While the UAE formally alleging CAIR to be a terrorist organisation is as reprehensible as it is self-serving, the forthcoming allegations that the move is abetting Islamophobia in the US are both precise and deserving.   </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Khaled A Beydoun is an Assistant Professor of Law at the Barry University Dwayne O Andreas School of Law.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">You don't need to remind Ukrainian Jews of their long history of oppression at the hands of local authorities. In light of the past, how is the remaining 100,000-strong Jewish community faring in newly independent Ukraine, particularly in the wake of recent Maidan protests, renewed nationalism and war with separatists in the east? When it comes to such questions, views can be somewhat nuanced.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To be sure, right-wing and anti-Semitic political parties, such as Svoboda, are a concern in current day Ukraine. If recent trends are any indication, however, anti-Semitic sentiment doesn't seem to be resonating much with Ukrainians. Indeed, Svoboda failed to attain the 5 percent threshold necessary to pick up seats in Ukraine's recent parliamentary election. Observers say the election was the first in which no political party played on anti-Semitism. Buoyed by such developments, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Election-results-buoy-Ukrainian-Jews-379969\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"InternalLink\">Jewish leaders</span> feel encouraged</a> and hope Ukraine will continue along a tolerant path.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Josef Zissels, General Council Chairman of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, believes that the threat of anti-Semitism has been greatly exaggerated. Zissel's office is located in Kiev's Podil neighbourhood, a former trading and Jewish quarter. To be sure, he concedes, there's some anti-Semitic sentiment at the lowest rungs of society, \"but in the mainstream and the top there's no place for this type of thing\". </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\"Compared to 2013, Zissels remarks, there’s been no increase in the number of anti-Semitic incidents this year.  For that matter, he adds, Ukraine displayed one of the lowest levels of anti-Semitism throughout Europe in 2013, with just 13 incidents.  </p>\r\n<p>In contrast, Zissels remarks, the U.S. had several hundred such incidents.  “We have more reason to worry about the U.S. than the U.S. worrying about us,” he declares.\"</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Anton Shekhovtsov, an expert on the European far-right and a research fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, echoes such views. In an interview, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.nikolaskozloff.com/blog.htm?post=964962\" target=\"_blank\">he expressed doubt</a> that right wing nationalists would be successful in electoral terms. Moreover, he adds, \"I'm sceptical that Ukrainians would ever rally to a programme aimed at ethnic cleansing' or the like.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To be sure, he says, \"it's sometimes very difficult to distinguish between civic and ethnic nationalism.\"  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Shekhovtsov is under the impression, however, \"that in general nationalism tends to take on a patriotic rather than a xenophobic character\" in Ukraine.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Legacy of Maidan</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Around Maidan, the square at the epicentre of earlier protests against the government of Viktor Yanukovych, Ukrainian flags flutter outside buildings and stores hock folkloric clothing. What is the place of Jews in modern day Ukraine, a country which has seen a recent surge in patriotic sentiment? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Though the EuroMaidan was oftentimes depicted in dark and ultra-nationalist colours,\" Shekhovtsov says, \"the movement has spurred the growth of a civic nation. The myth of the 'heavenly hundred' has helped to contribute and consolidate such civic-mindedness and constitutional patriotism.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Shekhovtsov is referring to the 100 or so martyrs at Maidan who were shot and killed by riot police. Ukrainians died there, but also Russians, Poles, Georgians, Armenians and even a few Jews.</span></p>\r\n<p>Back in Podil, Zissels pours cold water on the notion that Maidan represented some kind of backward or retrograde nationalism.</p>\r\n<p>\"No, no, no,\" he says, shaking his head. If anything, he remarks, the 2004 Orange Revolution, which also flared in Kiev's Maidan, was more nationalistic than recent protests against Yanukovych. Moreover, few members of ethnic minorities took part in the previous Maidan, in contrast to more current demonstrations.</p>\r\n<p>\"During [the recent] Maidan,\" Zissels declares, \"We Jews and other ethnic minorities did not feel threatened by what was happening.\"</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Zissels certainly concedes that right-wing nationalists were visible in the recent Maidan. However, he says, \"they don't play a major role…and they aren't very numerically strong\".</p>\r\n<p>In fact, when Yanukovych authorities tried to disperse protesters on Maidan, people formed self-defence units (including a \"Jewish Division\"), which had no links to right-wing nationalists. At the end of January, 2014 Zissels estimates that such self-defense units comprised some 15,000 people. At the time, nationalists affiliated with Svoboda had just several hundred people under its banner. </p>\r\n<p>Denis Pilash, a political activist who took part in Maidan protests, says \"demonstrators were playing all kinds of bad nationalistic music on stage.\" On the other hand, he adds, \"there was also a Jewish klezmer band and the majority of people were fine with that.\"</p>\r\n<p>Pilash adds that many Ukrainians \"are eager to embrace Jews and other ethnic minorities.\"</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, he guards against complacency and fears the political mainstream hasn't been sufficiently critical of the far right. Indeed, stereotypes and jokes about Jews persist, and \"there's always a certain tolerance for the right which could lead to resurgence.\" </p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Ukrainian Jews and the war</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>In light of intensifying hostilities in the east against Russian-separatists, such fears might not be unfounded. Tetiana Bezruk, a researcher at the Congress of National Communities of Ukraine, is concerned about the rise of the fascistic Azov Battalion which battles separatists while brandishing symbols similar to those worn by Waffen SS units during World War II.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Azov Battalion is one of the biggest problems right now,\" Bezruk remarks. \"People are very respectful toward anyone who is currently fighting, and it doesn't matter what your politics is.\"</p>\r\n<p>While many Ukrainian Jews are certainly aware of fascist military units, they are still keen to demonstrate their patriotism.</p>\r\n<p>Pereyaslav, located some 60 miles south of Kiev, was once home to Yiddish literary legend Shalom Aleichem (1859-1916) and the stage and film musical \"Fiddler on the Roof\" was based on his stories. Iryna Kucherenko, director of the Shalom Aleichem museum, says the local Jewish community isn't too concerned with right wing nationalism. Jewish women in Pereyaslav, she says, want to support the Ukrainian war effort by helping to provide soldiers with appropriate body armour. Kucherenko adds for good measure that a Jewish battalion recently deployed to the front. </p>\r\n<p>Perhaps, the war will serve to integrate Ukrainian Jews more fully into society. One local Jewish \"oligarch\", Igor Kolomoisky, recently created volunteer battalions which took part in the war. Kolomoisky is the governor of Dnipropetrovsk no less, an important industrial area. In media and political circles, Kolomoisky is referred to as a power broker and his ethnic or religious identity is glossed over. </p>\r\n<p>While it would be premature at this point to declare the death of anti-Semitism in Ukraine, figures such as Kolomoisky have done much to change attitudes. Indeed, through his own patriotic endeavours, he has made it hard to question Jewish loyalty to the Ukrainian state. Nevertheless, Ukrainians should be careful not to fall into a lull or fail to call out fascists in the midst of war.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Nikolas Kozloff is the author of Revolution!

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Presidents Xi Jingping and Barack Obama recently reached a bilateral agreement to reduce carbon emissions. <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">The landmark agreement, jointly announced in Beijing, includes new targets for carbon emissions reductions of 26 to 28 percent from the United States by 2025, and a first-ever commitment by China to stop its emissions from growing by 2030.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Since China and the United States are the two biggest national emitters of carbon, this could have a major impact on the world's ability to cope with the carbon threat. It is considered <span lang=\"EN\">essential to concluding a new global accord, because unless Beijing and Washington can resolve their differences, few other countries will agree to mandatory cuts in emissions.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">So this was an important accomplishment, but time will tell if both countries are able to fulfill this new commitment. In the aftermath of the agreement, much has been written that China's promises are still too vague and lack a credible plan. But what about the United States? Will the Obama administration - and whatever president succeeds him in 2016 - be able to deliver on its new commitment?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The recent elections, which saw the opposition Republican Party overwhelm the Democrats, taking over the US Senate and increasing its majority in the US House, does not make one optimistic. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">For starters, <span lang=\"EN\">the new Senate is set to be packed with a brand new crop of Republican climate change deniers and big boosters of fossil fuels who don't agree with the mainstream scientific consensus on global warming.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><STRONG><i>'War on coal'</i></STRONG><br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\">Colorado's new Republican senator, Cory Gardner, has said the Obama administration is waging \"a war on the kind of energy we use every day - fossil fuels … because they want to tell us how we live our lives\". </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\">Georgia's new senator David Perdue has <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/203914-small-government-gop-senate-candidate-has-ties-to-stimulus\" target=\"_blank\">slammed the Obama administration</a> for waging a \"war on coal\" and has called the federal Environmental Protection Agency's new rules to regulate carbon emissions \"shortsighted\". Montana's new senator Steven Daines believes global warming, to the extent that it exists at all, is probably caused by solar cycles. West Virginia's new senator Shelley Capito is a founding member of the Congressional Coal Caucus.</span></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These and other new Republican senators will join the current crop of top Congressional Republican leaders who have long been prominent climate change deniers, and who quickly criticised the US-China climate change pact. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Senator Mitch McConnell, who in January will become the Senate majority leader, House Speaker John Boehner and Senator Jim Inhofe, who is expected to chair the all-important Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, slammed the agreement in statements released shortly after the deal was announced.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Senator McConnell, who hails from the coal state of Kentucky, said: \"I read the agreement - it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states around the country.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Senator Inhofe criticised the deal as unfair and knocked the Chinese pledge as \"hollow and not believable ... The United States will be required to more steeply reduce our carbon emissions while China won't have to reduce anything\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Climate skeptics</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Senators McConnell and Inhofe made a pledge of their own, vowing to rein in regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a common target for Republicans. Inhofe told <span lang=\"EN\">climate skeptic think tank, the Heartland Institute, \"I will be replacing Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, so we can go back and start using CRAs - that's Congressional Review Acts - to repeal or to stop some of the onerous regulations that are taking place\".</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Many Americans strongly side with Obama, but Republican voters do not. Recent exit polls from the midterm elections showed that more than half of voters (57 percent) considered climate change or global warming a serious problem, but only 29 percent of Republican voters feel that way. So Republican leaders can proceed to obstruct Obama's regulations, confident that they have the support of their base of voters.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The hope of the Obama administration is that the agreement with Xi does not require congressional ratification. They believe that the president can cleverly use his executive branch powers over regulation and administration to implement certain changes.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But with the Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, they will have significant powers to obstruct and slow things down. For example, Republicans can attempt <span lang=\"EN\">to block Obama's plan to use the EPA to slash carbon emissions. Senator McConnell already has announced <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/e2-wire/223398-senate-gop-steeling-for-battle-against-the-epa\" target=\"_blank\">that his top priority</a> is \"to do whatever I can to get the EPA reined in\".</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Specifically, what Republicans want to target is the EPA's new power plant regulations, known as the Clean Power Plan. In the last decade, the EPA has won a series of Supreme Court battles allowing it to use the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"><STRONG><i>Litmus test</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">William Antholis, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, says the Republicans could go after the EPA’s funding, trying to reduce its staffing levels and abilities to monitor and regulate various carbon polluters and industries. Republicans also could launch \"more intrusive and time-consuming hearings on the EPA and the nature of climate regulations … House and Senate Republicans could make another attempt to strip the EPA of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Many are viewing the fate of Obama's EPA rules as a litmus test - it will show whether the US can credibly commit to climate action. And if the US can't make the grade, China, India and Brazil won't have much incentive to do so.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Additionally, Republicans could block appropriations for the US's contribution to the Green Climate Fund, a UN-administered account for climate adaptation in developing countries. Germany and France have each pledged $1 billion, but the US has yet to make a pledge. Failing to do so, or pledging a stingy amount, would also send a signal that the US is not as committed to climate action as it is asking other big emitters to be.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Senate Republicans also are virtually certain to try and push through the Keystone XL pipeline, which is at the top of their priority list. That pipeline, running from Canada's tar sands down to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico, requires special approval from the White House and from the State Department. The Republican majorities in both the House and Senate will be strategising ways to get the president to approve that pipeline, particularly by attaching it to other bills wanted by the president, or to a budget bill</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">If Republicans are successful in their all-out war on Obama's climate policies, it will not only undermine the US ability to live up to its agreement with Xi and the rest of the world, but it will further erode international confidence in the US's ability to be a leader on this issue.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Will Obama be able to deliver on his agreement with Xi? Or will any future US presidents even want to, especially if a Republican is elected in 2016? The outcome of this battle is by no means certain. Stay tuned.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"http://www.Steven-Hill.com\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Hill</a> is a political writer and author of \"Europe's Promise: Why the European Way is the Best Hope in an Insecure Age\".</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Last week, South Korean media reported that South Korean government agencies had finished the compilation of a <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2996877\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan of economic reforms</a> to be implemented in case of Korea's German-style unification. The plan dwells on how the South Korean government should handle such a scenario and what should be done to transform the North Korean economy. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The South Korean military is known to do regular rounds of contingency planning for a possible regime collapse in the North. However, such plans usually focus upon the immediate response of the military. The new plan is seemingly different because it considers what should be done in the longer-term. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">On paper, both Koreas are firmly committed to the principle of national unification. Of course, during official contacts between the two governments, both sides regularly pay lip service to the idea that their eventual unification should be peaceful, gradual and agreed upon by the two current governments, currently co-existing on the Korean peninsula. Some in South Korea sincerely believe that such pronouncements bear some relation to reality. But in real life, a gradual unification is highly unlikely, if not outright impossible. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Now, when the world celebrates the 25th anniversary of German unification, it is a good time to be reminded: If the two Koreas are to be re-united in the foreseeable future, the German scenario is highly likely to be repeated on the Korean peninsula. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Great triumph?</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Officially, Koreans on both sides of the border are supposed to believe that unification, in whatever form it eventually comes, would be a great triumph for their long-suffering nation - recently, the ROK president even said that unification would be a \"bonanza\" for her country. However, with the passage of time, it becomes increasingly clear that the younger generation of South Koreans have different opinions about unification. Put simply, younger Koreans do not see Northerners as their brethren, and are not willing to make sacrifices for the impoverished North. At the same time, there is a belief, especially among the younger generation, that the immediate <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/world/magazine/92781/korean-unification\" target=\"_blank\">economic impact of unification</a> is likely to be disastrous for the taxpayers of the rich South. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">There are significant reasons that should have the South Korean public worried. In the past decade or so, there have been over a dozen attempts to estimate how much unification is going to cost South Korea. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Given the near complete absence of reliable statistics regarding the state of the North Korean economy, and the near unprecedented nature of the task, one shouldn't be surprised that estimates vary considerably. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Be that as it may, most of the estimates cluster around two points: optimists believe that unification is likely to cost about $200 billion, while pessimists believe that the figure is liable to be in the neighbourhood of $1.5 trillion. Both camps believe that their respective figures represent the amount of money required to narrow the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704340304574635180086832934\" target=\"_blank\">income gap between the two Koreas</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Currently, the entire GDP of South Korea is <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2195.html\" target=\"_blank\">roughly $1.2 trillion</a>, so even at the low end we are talking about a massive burden. If pessimists are correct, the burden could be truly crushing, capable of wiping out the South Korean economy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Income gap</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Once upon a time, North Korea was well ahead of the South in its per capita income (largely, but not exclusively, because it inherited pretty much all the industry the Japanese companies built in Korea during the colonial industrialisation boom of the 1930s and 1940s). These years are long gone, though. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">After 1960, it would be a minor exaggeration to say that Korean economic history can be presented as the near perfect success of the South and near perfect failure of the North. The results are clear for all to see. Exact estimates remain impossible because the North Korean government ceased to release all economic statistics in the early 1960s, but the per capita GDP in the South has been estimated to be <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2013/apr/08/south-korea-v-north-korea-compared\" target=\"_blank\">between 14 and 30 times higher than the North</a>. Even if we take the most conservative estimate, this still means that the per capita income gap between the two Koreas is the world's largest gap between two countries that share a land border.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">When it comes to social and cultural issues, the gap is equally great. For security reasons, the North Korean government has always been very careful in controlling interaction between its citizens and the outside world. As a result, the average North Korean has very little understanding about the ways a modern society operates. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">It is not incidental that North Korean refugees in the South do not normally fare well: their average income is roughly half the nationwide average, they have great difficulties in finding work and basically find themselves ill-adapted to life in a modern, technologically advanced, hyper-dynamic and highly competitive society. Given that defectors usually come from more socially active groups of the population, this bodes ill for the future of a unified Korea. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">No wonder that the above mentioned report assume that the unemployment rate in the post-unification North might reach the totally unprecedented 30 percent level. Indeed, one can only wonder what would happen to North Korean engineers who might have good training in calculus, but have never used computers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Similarly, North Korean medical doctors who are well educated in treatments and drugs that would be seen as out of date in the 1960s are likely to be lost. Manual workers, trained in the 1930s technology, would also be of little use in the high-tech economy of the South. And what of the North Korean Army, one of the largest standing military forces in the world, that currently has over one million soldiers? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Exposure to capitalism</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Should German-style unification occur on the Korean peninsula, North Koreans would immediately find themselves exposed to the ways of modern capitalism, of which they currently have very vague ideas. One can easily imagine how South Korean speculators would descend on the North and buy all valuable property they can find (they will be able to afford it with their far higher incomes). And the scions of former North Korean landlords, whose lands were confiscated during the 1946 land reform, are also likely to reappear and make their claims on what used to be their great-grandfathers' lands.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This does not mean that unification will ruin the North Koreans. Most likely, in absolute terms it will bring fast and dramatic improvements to their living standards, albeit accompanied by great social confusion and, perhaps, sense of alienation. For the Southerners, things are different. In the long run, the unification will indeed make Korea a safer and better place, but its immediate impact will be a crushing blow to the South Korean taxpayers - and they are increasingly aware of this.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">All of this is understandable, but it does not negate one fact: unification can happen regardless of what people want and what they fear. History seldom cares about us, humble humans, and as the experience of countless crises and revolutions has shown, the situation can easily get out of control. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">After all, the existence of the rich South is a great destabilising factor in itself. East Germans challenged their state once it became clear that Soviet tanks would not come to crush their rebellion. They wanted western freedom and, even more, they wanted western prosperity.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><STRONG><i><em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Prominent French journalist Alain Gresh was detained by Egyptian police on November 11 after leaving a cafe in an upscale Cairo neighbourhood. Here, he gives us an account of what actually happened.</span></em></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">First, let's take a look at the facts. On November 9-10, I attended an EU-sponsored conference held in Cairo on \"problems of translation\". I decided to stay on a few more days to meet some people in order to take stock of any changes and iron out some problems related to the Arabic edition of <em>Le Monde Diplomatique</em>.</span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> On November 11, at 11am, in an upscale cafe located in front of the British Embassy - whose impressive size serves as a reminder that Britain once ruled over an occupied Egypt - I met two Egyptian friends: One is a columnist, the other a student. The place was small and the tables are very near to each other, but I did not pay attention to our neighbours. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> The conversation went on; we were speaking in both Arabic and English about what was happening in the country, the situation in the universities and the state of the media. After half an hour, a well-dressed lady sitting next to us - and of whom I had taken no notice - stood-up visibly furious and addressed us, before leaving the place, saying: \"You want to destroy the country!\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> We did not respond and continued our conversation. Shortly afterwards, a man entered the cafe, presumably an agent of the \"mukhabarat\" (state intelligence) and sat down - but we did not pay attention to him either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> <STRONG><i> Apprehended </i></STRONG> <br /> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> The moment we stepped out of the cafe, <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/world/middleeast/journalists-detained-for-talking-politics-in-cairo-cafe.html?_r=0\"> we were apprehended </a> by that same man, who had left the place just before we did, and some other officers in uniform. It is worth mentioning that we were well treated throughout. The police even brought a chair to one of the two women who was pregnant. Then they took our identity papers and started questioning each one of us, there in the street. In my case, they asked where I was staying in Cairo, why I changed hotels during my stay and when I arrived in Egypt. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> After half an hour, they gave me back my passport and told me to leave. I refused, as the other two people were not free to leave too. Five minutes later, they took my passport again, and one of the officers asked me if I had an authorisation from the Ministry of Information; I did not. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Following my answer, that same officer, thinking he had me cornered, replied: \"And if I had to interview people in France, wouldn't I need authorisation?\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> He was surprised by my negative response. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> An hour later, I informed the French Embassy as well as the head of the Egyptian Journalists' Syndicate. Following this episode, many figures were informed including, apparently, the Egyptian prime minister and most certainly the interior ministry. I was then set \"free\". But again, the two women were still not free to leave. For this reason, I refused to leave without them and again called the head of the Journalists' Syndicate. Finally they let us all go. The incident lasted an hour and a half. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Back at the hotel, at 6 pm, I received a call from the interior ministry. I was told that a car would pick me up and take me to the ministry. A meeting was held with the deputy minister of human rights (a military general) in the presence of other generals. Apologies were expressed, saying it was a \"mistake\" to have arrested me. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">  This incident raises three important questions. The most serious issue at stake is obviously not the arrest itself, but the fact that we have been denounced by a \"good citizen\". This move reflects the dominating atmosphere in the country and to which most of the media, including the privately-owned ones, are contributing. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> <STRONG><i> Harming the state </i></STRONG> <br /> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Recently, newspapers and TV channels' directors have argued that because of the war on terrorism, they refrain from publishing any information that could harm the state - albeit, hundreds of journalists have signed a petition against that.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span>Moreover, TV channels denounce anyone who makes the slightest criticism. Journalists with different views have been practically excluded from daily newspapers' columns. A segment of the public is very vigilant, convinced that Egypt is subject to an insidious European-US-Israeli plot - which is quite ironic, given the strong relationship between Cairo and Tel Aviv now. The atmosphere is reminiscent of the United States in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, which was summed up by President George W Bush's slogan: \"Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\"</span><br /><br /><span>The second issue is about the power of social media that spread the news of my experience with a speed and force that surprised me. Within hours, the word spread across the world. I have received many messages of support. I have been interviewed by numerous TV channels. The Commissioner of the European Union responsible for human rights issues has even issued a condemnation</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Thirdly, I cannot help but think that these reactions, partly exaggerated, were related to my status as a \"white journalist\". In other words, there are thousands of political prisoners in Egypt, some of whom are on hunger strike and may die, as well as arbitrary arrests and proven cases of torture that should be raising more indignation and condemnation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> That being said, all the better if this incident draws attention to those cases. My thoughts go primarily to the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/ahmed-seif-egypt-prison-generat-201491464914579626.html\" target=\"_blank\"> political prisoners on hunger strike </a> , including Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Sultan. The deteriorating human rights situation, the decline of democratic liberties in Egypt should not let anyone remain indifferent, certainly not those who consider themselves friends of Egypt and its people. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"> Alain Gresh is deputy director of Le Monde Diplomatique and a specialist on the Middle East.  </span></i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This article was written in French by Alain Gresh and translated into English by <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/profile/ali-saad.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ali Saad</a>.</span></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ever since my song \"Irhal\" became known as one of the most important songs of the Egyptian uprising, there has been a myth about the way the song was written and how I emerged as a \"singer of the Revolution\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The story goes like this: I was an unknown singer who was moved like so many other Egyptians to come to defend the still unsure revolution on January 30, 2011, from my hometown of Mansoura. After listening to the street chants for a day, I wrote \"Irhal\" (Leave!) in a fit of inspiration and began playing it for increasingly large crowds. Within a few days, it had spread across Tahrir, Egypt, and the world thanks to a video uploaded to YouTube. By the time Hosni Mubarak was forced from power, I had been transformed into a symbol of the revolutionary youth who toppled \"The Pharaoh\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The broad outlines of the story are true, but there is one very important piece of my history missing. I did not show up at Tahrir and write \"Irhal\" out of nowhere. I had been writing political songs for several years - songs that I'd never had the chance to play in public until the revolution - to capture the anger, hopelessness, and yet, hope, of my generation. \"Irhal\" was the result of a long process of political development that I and so many of my peers had undergone in the previous years.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">After the January 25 revolution, music and politics were fused together for me, just like art and politics were for all the amazing artists who painted the murals on Muhammad Mahmoud Street. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>No better place to sing</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">There was something about Tahrir that was special, transcendent, even when there weren't many people, or it was pouring rain, or the police were shooting at us - there was no place I would have rather been at, and no better place to write a song.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Something changed, however, during the rule of Mohamed Morsi. Politics started to feel like it had under Mubarak. Revolutionaries were pushed from the political stage, and it became harder for me to practise my art, or spread a revolutionary message. After the Ittihadiyya protests of late 2012, when the Muslim Brotherhood actually fought alongside security and military forces against pro-democracy protesters, it was clear the revolution would have to rise up against Morsi. But what the millions of people who marched against Morsi didn't understand was that the military was not our friend.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Perhaps because I had felt the full force of the military's brutality when they tortured me in March 2011, and seeing so many of my friends and revolutionaries beaten, imprisoned, tortured and killed by the government, I never could trust the military to bring Egypt closer to democracy. And I knew that my job as an artist was to constantly remind my fellow Egyptians of this fact.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">That is why I couldn't simply support the Tamarrod <span>(a pro-military youth) </span>movement when they led the massive protests against Morsi. I could see Tahrir Square changing as the protests grew. It was no longer the Tahrir I knew. People didn't know the songs of the revolution, and they were supporting the military, and even the police - the group against whom the revolution started. As I feared, once Morsi was removed on July 3, Tahrir and Egypt became a very different place. It was not a revolutionary space - although I know it will be again. The victory of the counter-revolution was confirmed when 1,000 Egyptians were massacred by the government, with hardly any protest from Egyptians.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Revolutionary voices</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">By the summer of 2013, it was almost impossible for me to play anywhere. By the time the third anniversary of January 25 came around, there was very little space for any revolutionary voices. I could upload my music - and in fact new songs could get 100,000 views in a day - but I couldn't be with Egyptians, with my guitar, on the street, where I always felt most at home.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">I didn't have it the worst by any means, as so many friends and comrades had been arrested, jailed and awaiting trials. Journalists, bloggers, civil society activists - everyone was being targeted, and when their families would protest their illegal detention and mistreatment, the best they could hope for was for themselves to be arrested and held for trial too. This disaster was epitomised by the imprisonment of blogger and activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, and then his younger sister Sanaa Seif, during which time their father, the human rights pioneer Ahmed Seif, died.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">No matter what has happened, I refused to stop addressing social and political issues in my songs. As an artist and citizen, I feel an obligation to be engaged in my society and add to the democratic process. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Still, the situation has only become harder, and ultimately impossible for me as an artist. </span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As important, because of travel restrictions imposed on me, I have also had to turn down offers for concerts and lectures abroad. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Dialogue</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Democracy is about dialogue. It is not about shutting down ideas or artistic expressions which may be in opposition to the majority or the ruling system. Due to restrictions and censorship, this dialogue is not possible in Egypt now. Nothing is more evident of this than the ongoing arrests and long-term imprisonment of young Egyptian activists, such as the 23 who were sentenced to three years in jail less than two weeks ago.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In a situation where there is little room for revolutionary art, the Swedish city of Malmo generously offered me a two-year residence as artist. During my stay in Europe, I will continue to disagree with the government on many issues, including its oppression of university students, who have to live with constant harassment, monitoring and attacks on their campuses.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">I have just finished recording my first song in Sweden, \"Nashid at-toulab\" (The students' anthem) to support the students as part of a new album of revolutionary songs. I will continue to write, perform, and reach out to artists and audiences in Europe and beyond to help my generation continue the struggle for freedom, inside and outside Egypt. The revolution must - and will - continue.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ramy Essam is an Egyptian singer and activist.

These included many public intellectuals and popular journalists as well as some of the country's \"social media active\" middle class, which made the anti-Ponta message that much more vocal in the public space.</p>\r\n<p>There are countless reasons to oppose Ponta and his party, which has been holding executive power since 2012. Over the past two years, the Social-Democrats have supported legislation that would give immunity to corrupt politicians, criminalise investigative journalism, and give extraordinary powers to corporations in the extractive sector.</p>\r\n<p>Ponta is notoriously unreliable: While in opposition, he criticised austerity only to implement IMF-dictated austerity measures once in power; before taking office, he opposed the Rosia Montana gold mining project that brought <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/stopping-europe-biggest-gold-mine-20131117102859516331.html\" target=\"_blank\">tens of thousands to the streets</a> in 2013, only to get behind it as soon as he became prime minister.</p>\r\n<p>And yet, in their electoral zeal, his opponents have gone too far. In the past few weeks, their rhetoric has gone as far as demonising his poor electorate, which does not bode well for Romania's political future.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>'Down with the communists!'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>These elections mark the end of Traian Basescu's ten years of domination over political life in Romania; he is about to give up his presidential seat to his soon-to-be-elected successor. For the first time in a while, the centre-right electorate could leave battered and bruised Basescu behind and look to new candidates.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, two figures relatively fresh to national politics gathered most of these voters' sympathy. One was Klaus Iohannis, a Romanian of German origin who has been enjoying long-term success as mayor of the city of Sibiu; he represents the Christian-Liberal Alliance made up of the two main centre-right parties. The other was Monica Macovei, a former justice minister credited with implementing the reforms needed to get Romania into the European Union; she ran as an independent.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The emergence of these two political figures came against the backdrop of a turbulent year. In 2013, some of the strongest protests in Romania's post-socialist history rocked the country and led to the indefinite postponement of a project to build a gold mine at Rosia Montana in Apuseni Mountains. During those demonstrations, many felt for the first time that they can and should make a difference in the political life of their country. For some, the presidential elections this year constituted a major opportunity to see an electoral expression of the street movement.</p>\r\n<p>This sentiment intensified the public debate around the presidential elections. And because centre-right opinion-makers were influential in framing the discussion, the centre-right vs socialists conflict has been presented as a clash between democrats vs communists, good vs evil, salvation vs doom.</p>\r\n<p>According to this narrative, Ponta's socialists are really the communists who destroyed the country before 1989 and whose corruption and retrograde views on the economy are now preventing Romania from modernising further and better integrating with the EU. The centre-right candidates, particularly Macovei and Iohannis, were presented as guarantors of a non-corrupt, well-functioning and truly European Romania.</p>\r\n<p>In the first round of the elections on November 2, Ponta got 40 percent of the votes (turnout was a little over 50 percent). Iohannis was the runner-up with 30 percent and will face Ponta in this Sunday's runoff. Other centre-right candidates, including Macovei, scored around 5 percent. There was no other candidate claiming to represent the left from a total of fourteen running, apart of Ponta and a representative of a virtually unknown old-style communist party who got 0.3 percent. </p>\r\n<p>The first round came with another reason to hate Ponta. Bureaucratic procedures and insufficient voting booths led to thousands of Romanians living abroad in Western Europe <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNYTSUdo0KY\" target=\"_blank\">not being able to vote</a>. Many saw this as a strategy of the socialists to exclude voters who would otherwise have voted for the centre-right (indeed, Romanians abroad voted mostly for Iohannis).</p>\r\n<p>Anti-Ponta protests in major Western European cities and in Romania ensued. In Romanian towns, thousands marched chanting \"Down with the communists!\" and recycling slogans form last year's Rosia Montana demos.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Blame the poor</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>A particularly worrying turn in the public debate took place as emotions escalated: Antipathy for Ponta turned into hatred for those voting for him. The main centre-right commentators insisted that educated Romanians from the west of the country voted for Iohannis, while uneducated people from poor towns and villages in the east voted for Ponta.</p>\r\n<p>A stark opposition was created between Iohannis voters who supposedly care for the rule of law and work hard to push the economy forward, and Ponta's electors who are allegedly interested only in getting social assistance and pre-electoral bribes (the Socialists' dubious practice of making payments to teachers or distributing food right before elections was widely publicised). Some radical commentators even questioned the benefits of universal voting.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of the practices of the socialists, the verbal violence with which some journalists and intellectuals turned against those who voted for this party was shocking. </p>\r\n<p>Ponta's presidential programme is the only one which pays some lip service to issues of social justice (though his so-called \"pro-business leftist\" programme bears uncanny resemblance to liberal Iohannis' programme and is far from a serious leftist proposition). While social protection measures taken by Ponta are no more than patching up (marginal increases in public salaries and pensions, minor hikes in minimal wage), no other candidate speaks of anything else but further economic liberalisation and budgetary discipline.</p>\r\n<p>Iohannis' vision of Romania centres on a liberalised, competitive economy where businesses thrive and education is geared towards technological progress. He addresses exclusively the winners of transition.</p>\r\n<p>But in Romania, one in five employees cannot make a living out of their salary and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/People_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion\" target=\"_blank\">40 percent of people</a> are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Many have been further impoverished by <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://m.aljazeera.com/story/201211893834749122\" target=\"_blank\">austerity measures</a> implemented since 2008. In these conditions, it is not unreasonable that people fear politicians who promise more liberalisation of the economy and a minimalist state, the main line pursued by governments over the past decade and more.</p>\r\n<p>Ponta is a poor choice for Romania. But Iohannis is no dream proposition either. Not only does he speak only to the successful but, despite the current antagonism with Ponta, he was an ally of the socialists twice between 2009 and 2012, and his own party too is tainted by corruption.</p>\r\n<p>It is naive to think that if Ponta loses on Sunday, things will turn out fine. Not caring for the needs of a large part of the population is not only immoral but also unreasonable. We just need to look at other societies in the European Union to see what happens if poor people are ignored for too long. In Poland, Romania's model in the East, unemployed youth <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/cloneofburning-down-rainbow-poland-2013111293719-2013111343533605488.html\" target=\"_blank\">join the far-right</a>. In the UK, hopeless youth came out into the streets in uncontrollable riots in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, Romanians from all social classes and of all political colours came together to fight against a mining project that would have meant the crushing of some poor villagers by a rich corporation supported by corrupted politicians from all parties. In 2014, protesters use the same slogans to support one politician against another while the poor and peasants are demonised for supposedly voting for the socialists.</p>\r\n<p>The 2014 protesters may mean well but, to be sure, most of them are just defending their own interests by promoting centre-right Iohannis. For any chance of a bright future in Romania, both the future president and Romanians themselves must resurrect another value learnt on the streets in 2013: solidarity.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Claudia Ciobanu is a freelance reporter based in Warsaw, contributing among others to <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ipsnews.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Inter Press Service</a>  and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://opendemocracy.net/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenDemocracy</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Follow her on Twitter: <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Claudia_Warsaw\" target=\"_blank\">@Claudia_Warsaw</a></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p>Twenty-five years ago, the Berlin Wall came down. John F Kennedy's famous speech \"I am a Berliner\" had made that wall the symbol of the West that embodies the \"other\" against which it fought for decades, justifying countless wars and dictatorships as well as internal repression. November 9, 1989 marked the end of the Cold War confrontation, and the Arab and Muslim populations became the new enemy.</p>\r\n<p>The year 2002 saw the construction of a new wall, much longer, much higher - a tool of large scale confiscation of land and resources and ethnic cleansing. The Israeli apartheid wall, built on occupied Palestinian land, effectively creates Bantustans, separating Palestinian farmers from their farmland, families from their relatives, and children from their schools. It makes a Palestinian state or self-determination impossible. Sadly, today, this wall is the very symbol of the \"free\" world's own paradigm: Under the cover of \"security\" and \"self-defence\", everything is justified.</p>\r\n<p>Jerusalem and Israel's apartheid Wall are the new symbolic battle field. There are no US airlifts or grandiose speeches, just the daily resistance against Israel's attempts to exclude Palestinians and their neighbourhoods from the city in order to annihilate Palestinian existence there and deny Palestinians Jerusalem as their capital.</p>\r\n<p>On November 7, clashes spread all across occupied East Jerusalem. In Shuafat refugee camp alone, dozens of people were injured. In Bir Nabala, the popular committee tore down a piece of the apartheid wall. Palestinians in Jerusalem aren't waiting for the international community to comply with their obligation to ensure Israel tears down the wall, as reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice in its 2004 verdict. Already, the protests in Jerusalem have spread to Palestinian citizens of Israel in the Galilee and throughout the West Bank. Today, is the moment for people worldwide to stand in solidarity, denouncing the connivance of their own political leadership, by stating \"I am a Jerusalemite.\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>The 'Jerusalem Intifada'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Jerusalem has always been central in Israeli strategies. During its ethnic cleansing campaigns in 1948, the most cruel and emblematic massacre of Palestinian civilians occurred in Deir Yasin, on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Since the occupation of the eastern part of the city in 1967, Israel has worked relentlessly to annex all of Jerusalem and to erase Palestinian presence in the city. Lately, Israeli aggression in Jerusalem has risen exponentially.</p>\r\n<p>In the past two months, Israel announced over 3,600 new settlement housing units in and around Jerusalem, grabbing more Palestinian land for Jewish settlers. In the neighbourhood of Silwan, illegal settlers took over <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/israeli-settlers-over-25-homes-e-jerusalem-residents-224044530.html\" target=\"_blank\">25 Palestinian apartments</a>.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Adding to this, Israel has sparked the ire of the entire Muslim world by attacking the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the surrounding Noble Sanctuary compound. Over the last six months, the Israeli army and settlers, joined regularly by Israeli political leaders, have invaded the area almost daily. Israel now routinely closes the Noble Sanctuary to Palestinians in the morning hours. Muslim men under 50 and women under 40 are barred from entering Al-Aqsa.</p>\r\n<p>Those entering are forced to leave their ID cards and many are then called for Israeli police interrogation when exiting. For the first time since Salahuddin liberated Jerusalem from the crusaders, Israeli occupation forces twice completely closed down the Noble Sanctuary compound, even prohibiting the call to prayer. Across the entire city, Palestinians are intimidated by ever increasing Israeli police presence.</p>\r\n<p>Israel's onslaught on Jerusalem aims at not only complete dominance over the Palestinian capital and holy places, it also works in parallel with the effort to create a settlement corridor from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea in order to advance the Bantustanisation of the West Bank. This would be a further phase of Ariel Sharon's plan to \"disengage\" from all Palestinian ghettos trapped behind the apartheid wall while annexing the rest of the land and making any Palestinian self-determination impossible.</p>\r\n<p>In the hills that stretch from Jerusalem to the Jordan Valley, 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities are currently being ethnically cleansed. Simultaneously, projects are under way to open a tunnel from al Aizariya to Anata while closing the historic roads connecting the southern West Bank with the north. In June, the checkpoint north of Bethlehem was temporarily closed to those without a necessary permit as a test run for the isolation of southern West Bank.</p>\r\n<p>Confronted with this reality, Israeli repression serves only an internal discourse as politicians call for excessive force to rehabilitate their self-perception as an invincible power, especially after the military defeat this summer in Gaza. It does nothing to subdue Palestinian resistance.</p>\r\n<p>The daunting images of 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdair, who was abducted and burned alive by a group of Israeli settlers on June 2, triggered the current \"Jerusalem Intifada\". Only Israel's terrifying attack on Gaza was able to divert the anger and the protests in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Galilee. Immediately after the massacre, they intensified again as Israel announced more settlement units and the confiscation of 4,000 dunums (400 hectares) of Palestinian land in occupied Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>A third Intifada?</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>It is no wonder that one of the widespread slogans in the protests in Jerusalem is \"Come on West Bank, for God's sake!\" While there are dozens of protests in the West Bank heating up, a full scale third Intifada has yet to erupt.</p>\r\n<p>One reason is that protesters in the West Bank in addition to Israeli repression, face the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) police forces prohibiting protests in areas under its control as part of a \"security coordination\" with Israel. The second obstacle is the lack of a united political leadership.</p>\r\n<p>The president of the PNA, Mahmoud Abbas, has repeatedly spoken out against a third Intifada. Palestinian political parties so far have not shown sufficient responsiveness to develop a national strategy of resistance that could capitalise politically on the sacrifices of an Intifada. After the First Intifada that resulted in the Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada, which led to a strengthening of neoliberal and pro-US currents in the PNA, Palestinians are rightly sceptical over the possible political outcomes of another Intifada without the necessary leadership.</p>\r\n<p>The most strategic calls of the Palestinian struggle today are coming from the streets: Support for the resistance and the rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, accession to the Rome Statute to bring Israeli war criminals to trial and an immediate end to \"security cooperation\" between the PNA and Israel. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity have to be held accountable.</p>\r\n<p>This simple three point agenda being developed in the streets of Palestine seems to have more potential to break the current stalemate of repression and build a solid basis for the inevitable outbreak of a third Intifada than the diplomatic projects of the Palestinian and the world's leadership.</p>\r\n<p>It's time for all of us, in Palestine and across the globe, to assert \"We are all Jerusalemites.\"</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Jamal Juma is the general coordinator of the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stopthewall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop the Wall Campaign</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Maren Mantovani is coordinator of international relations of the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.stopthewall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop the Wall Campaign</a>. </i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p>Bob Geldof is to re-record Band Aid's \"Do they know it's Christmas?\" the 1984 charity anthem that mobilised resources for a famine that devastated parts of northern Ethiopia and present day Eritrea between 1983 and 1985. </p>\r\n<p>He has again brought together famous friends such as One Direction, Bono, and Chris Martin of Coldplay for what is, remarkably, the song's fourth revival. This time, Geldof says he hopes to raise resources to fight Ebola. On the surface that seems like an act of goodwill, so what's wrong with it? Plenty.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>A distorted image of victimhood</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Band Aid, and the related Live Aid concerts, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4100000/newsid_4101800/4101879.stm\" target=\"_blank\">raised over $100m</a> for the Ethiopian famine victims. They galvanised a public that had largely been indifferent, marking a watershed for how celebrities engaged with humanitarian issues and how organisations conducted fundraising appeals. However, <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.metrolyrics.com/do-they-know-its-christmas-lyrics-band-aid.html\" target=\"_blank\">with unfounded and inaccurate lyrics</a>, the Christmas song not only created misconceptions about Ethiopia, but it did so in a patronising way.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the fact the famine was localised to northern Ethiopia and a result of political manipulation, the songs, concerts, and fundraising appeals perpetuated a single, negative, and distorted view of Ethiopia, making it synonymous with famine, poverty, and desperation.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The Band Aid and Live Aid campaigns left Ethiopia with a stigma that Ethiopians and Africans carry to this day. In fact, according to a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC1830.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2001 research study</a> on the legacy of Live Aid, 80 percent of British citizens associate the developing world with poverty, hunger and need. This type of stigma doesn't just leave Africans with a public relations problem; it can have broader implications for tourism, investments and other opportunities necessary for self-governance and autonomy.</p>\r\n<p>While the historical context described above is important to understanding the strong reactions against #BandAid30, the problem also lies in its detachment from reality today. Africa and African countries have changed. Whereas in 1985, Ethiopians, under a repressive, communist regime, were not able to organise, Liberians, Sierra Leoneans, and Guineans have been responding to Ebola since the beginning of the outbreak in March.  </p>\r\n<p>Community institutions and civil society organisations in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea have temporarily suspended all their non-Ebola programmes, launched aggressive education campaigns, built temporary holding centres, and taken care of children and families affected by Ebola. They are not helpless victims waiting for western saviours. They can, however, benefit from support and solidarity in the form of financial and technical resources.</p>\r\n<p>While African governments and philanthropists were slow to respond at first, there has been a growing crescendo of giving for Ebola.<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/faraigundan/2014/11/10/billionaires-aliko-dangote-strive-masiyiwa-patrice-motsepe-join-fight-against-ebola/\" target=\"_blank\"> Three of Africa's richest men</a>, Patrice Motsepe, Aliko Dangote, and Tony Elumelu, have given $1m, $800,000 and $600,000 respectively, and on November 8, the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://saharareporters.com/2014/11/10/african-union-steps-its-financial-support-victims-ebola-outbreak-following-criticism\" target=\"_blank\">African Union pushed the private sector</a> to give over $28.5m in pledges.</p>\r\n<p>The African diaspora has also taken it upon itself to act as an intermediary of resources and knowledge with initiatives like <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.lunchboxgift.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lunchbox</a> and Africa Responds. The latter aims to mobilise resources to support local organisations that are fighting Ebola on the ground, ensuring communities that are affected by Ebola are able to overcome the outbreak through their own efforts.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>New lyrics</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Still, there is something commendable about Geldof adding his voice to the Ebola response. Compared to other humanitarian emergencies, the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-fundraising-suffers-in-hierarchy-of-disasters-1.2768061\" target=\"_blank\">fight against Ebola is severely underfunded</a>. However, a song that is a model of bad aid should not have been recycled. With plans to record the new version on November 15, the ship has certainly sailed.</p>\r\n<p>Let's hope, at the very least, that he will heed the constructive criticism that #BandAid30 has received and improve the message in the song's latest reincarnation. For a start, it would be great if he could get African artists - especially those from affected countries - into the recording booth as well.</p>\r\n<p>Geldof has declared his intention to tweak the lyrics, but they need a complete overhaul. He says the proceeds will go to charity, but he should allocate at least a portion for indigenous organisations that are at the forefront of the fight against Ebola. This would be a bold move in a world that still favours international organisations when it comes to responding to Africa's emergencies.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Band Aid is a relic of an old era that patronised Africa. Clearly, many Africans still associate it with a dark period in which our humanity, dignity and agency were trumped by sensationalist humanitarianism. We now know that there are more effective ways of responding to emergencies, and a central part of that is supporting and strengthening the local response. Africans are now more connected to each other, and to the rest of the world, than at any other time in history.</span></p>\r\n<p>Put simply, 30 years on, African countries have changed.</p>\r\n<p>So should Geldof's song. </p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Solome Lemma is cofounder of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://africansinthediaspora.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Africans in the Diaspora</a> and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://africaresponds.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Responds</a>.</i></STRONG></em></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Follow her on Twitter: <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://twitter.com/InnovateAfrica\" target=\"_blank\">@InnovateAfrica</a></i></STRONG></em></p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Last month, an imam at a Mombasa mosque was forced to step down by young al-Shabab sympathisers, and just last week a Muslim cleric, Sheikh Salim Bakari Mwarangi, was gunned down by two men on a motorbike. His murder has underlined a dichotomy within Kenya's Muslim community. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">There are those, especially among the youth, who directly or indirectly support the Somali-based armed group al-Shabab; while others actively work to eradicate extremism within their religious and social milieu. In the latter group there are individuals who oppose al-Shabab and its ilk, but are also openly critical of the Kenyan government and what they view as its discrimination against Muslims. Both the pro-Shabab and anti-Shabab groups include clerics and Islamic scholars as well as ordinary citizens. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Kenya's coastal tourist region, which is home to many Muslims, has recently been targeted by a spate of bomb attacks linked to al-Shabab; and Mwarangi's death is the latest of several murders of Muslim clerics on both sides of the divide. In April, Imam Abubakar Shariff (aka Makaburi), known for his <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/feeding-grievances-killing-mak-2014411151431791922.html\" target=\"_blank\">scathing views on the government's approach to Muslims</a> and regarded as pro-Shabab, was killed by unknown assailants. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Then in June, another imam, Sheik Mohammed Idris, was shot after receiving death threats from extremist youths because he urged police to arrest them after they disrupted prayers at his mosque. Both Mwarangi and Idris are described by associates as peace activists but were deemed traitors by the youths.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"><STRONG><i>Threat inside Kenya</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">That al-Shabab is currently a threat inside Kenya is patently true. Insiders confirm that indigenous Kenyans constitute the largest non-Somali contingent within the organisation; and al-Shabab's present emasculation within Somalia may be a factor behind its recent upsurge of activity on Kenyan soil. The economic, political, and social marginalisation of Kenyan Muslims and Muslim areas in Kenya has provoked widespread resentment and frustration within that community; some of their grievances are detailed in the forthcoming <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-175282/muslims-plan-boycott-dinner-state-house\" target=\"_blank\">Sharawe Report</a>. Such grievances provide a fertile incubator for radical militancy, especially among unemployed and disaffected youth. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">A 2011 UN Monitoring Group report detailed how the Muslim Youth Centre (MYC), which began as a community organisation and rights forum to articulate the social, economic and religious peripheralisation of the youth of Majengo in the slum of Pumwani on the outskirts of Nairobi, evolved into an al-Shabab recruitment agency.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">It's quite a stretch from optimistically operating Majengo's first library, nursery school and orphan feeding scheme to recruiting and financing terrorists. But despair and frustration in the face of perceived discrimination and disinterest can harden idealism and radicalise activists, especially when combined with literal interpretations of religious texts that promise alluring rewards in the afterlife. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">That some politicians, securocrats and the media have tended to conflate al-Shabab with entire communities (all Muslims and/or all Somalis) has also exacerbated the situation and further alienated many Kenyan Muslims. It is extremely dangerous for politicians to manipulate fears over terrorism to demonise opponents, particularly when there are increasing incidents of xenophobia within a society. President Uhuru Kenyatta's fingering of his political opponents for the June 2014 Poromoko massacre is a case in point, especially since al-Shabab had claimed responsibility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Moreover, heavy-handed police tactics such as mass-roundups of young men at mosques, have only served to reinforce perceptions of prejudice against Muslims by the anti-terrorism police. Counterterrorism operations such as Usalama Watch, launched by the security forces in April 2014, appeared to indiscriminately target Kenya's Somali population, regardless of age or affiliation, with reports of human rights violations being documented by Amnesty International, among others.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Yet until October 2011, when the Kenyan Defence Force launched Operation \"Linda Nchi\" (Swahili for \"Protect the Nation\") into Somalia following several cross-border kidnappings that the government attributed to al-Shabab, the latter had not carried out any large scale attacks in Kenya, with its leadership probably calculating that this was not in their best interests. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"><STRONG><i>Pivotal incident</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">After Linda Nchi was launched and with the subsequent absorption of the Kenyan troops into the multi-country African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), al-Shabab has staged various attacks in Kenya, most notably the prolonged <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/mysteries-linger-over-westgate--201492171737803205.html\" target=\"_blank\">attack on Nairobi's Westgate Mall</a> in September 2013.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">For many Kenyans, Westgate was a pivotal incident, in much the same way as 9/11 was for Americans. The escalation of fear and outrage hardened anti-Muslim and anti-Somali perceptions among many Kenyans; while Kenyan Muslims increasingly felt they were under siege and being unfairly tarred with the taint of radicalism. Both sets of attitudes have continued to feed on each other in a vicious and unending cycle. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\"><a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.issafrica.org/uploads/Paper265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Anneli Botha of the Institute for Security Studies,</a> who interviewed dozens of Kenyan militant youths, notes that \"when asked to clarify [what] finally pushed them over the edge, the majority … referred to injustices at the hands of Kenyan security forces, specifically referring to 'collective punishment'.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">She argues that tactics such as mass arrests, racial profiling and extrajudicial killings have radicalised dozens, if not hundreds, of individuals to ensure a new wave of radicalism and collective resolve among groups such as al-Shabab. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Policy makers in Kenya need to take note and act fast. A recent <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/~http://www.aljazeera.com/media/files/africa/horn-of-africa/kenya/b102-kenya-al-shabaab-closer-to-home.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report by the International Crisis Group</a> urges that the recommendations of the Sharawe Report be implemented and warns that Kenyan leaders must stop scoring political points by manipulating tensions between Kenyans of different ethnicities and faiths. Unless Kenyans from the across the spectrum come together with a common vision to address the underlying causes of the divisions between Muslims and other communities, as well as within the Kenyan Muslim community itself, those divisions will continue to be exploited by radicals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Young Kenyan Muslims must be given alternatives beyond the Hobson's choice they currently perceive: A life of relative deprivation under a state that they feel is both disinterested in them and actively discriminates against them; or a false dream of eternal glory purveyed via a perverted religiosity that exploits their alienation.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-ZA\">Ayesha Kajee is a human rights activist and political analyst with a special focus on African governance and development.

Its aim called the <span>''Heart</span> of <span>Asia''</span> is to help stabilise Afghanistan, create peace and help economic aid to that war-torn country.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>China's kick start</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">China alone announced the start of 64 programmes to give the newly elected government a kick start, as western forces withdraw from the country, even though Afghanistan is experiencing the worst bout of Taliban attacks for years. In Kabul alone since Ghani took office on September 29, there have been nearly 20 Taliban attacks that have killed dozens of people. The military situation in the provinces is even more dire. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">At the conference, China pledged $327m as a grant to Afghanistan over three years and fully backed Ghani's plea, \"to invite the Taliban to join and enter an Afghan dialogue, and ask all of our international partners to support an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process\". He went on to say that <span>''peace</span> is our highest priority\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The remarks were Ghani's first in holding out an olive branch to the Taliban.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang echoed Ghani's call, urging groups to, \"lay aside former enmity and join the political reconciliation process\". Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed the hope that the Istanbul Process and all political parties in Afghanistan would work towards reconciliation through dialogue and negotiations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">More significant was that China - which normally avoids all kind of peace making initiatives - immediately embraced the idea of talks and proposed setting up a committee of regional countries to help Ghani talk to the Taliban. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This, according to western diplomats in Beijing who attended the conference, was immediately shot down by the hardline Russian representative who cited inherent dangers in talking to terrorists. It is still quite possible that China can form a joint committee with Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran to talk to the Taliban but Russia's absence will create a big vacuum. </span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Dire threat</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet Russia faces a dire threat from Afghanistan which it is fully aware of. The presidents of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have both recently expressed concern about the threat posed by militants belonging to several groups such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) now gathering on Afghanistan's borders with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These Central Asian groups assisted by Taliban and Pakistan militants are fighting Afghan government forces in the three provinces of Kunar, Nuristan and Kunduz in order to create a corridor from their bases in Pakistan through Afghanistan into Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan and eventually Russia. They are attempting to capture the strategic border town of Kunduz in northeastern Afghanistan. Recent fighting in the northeastern corridor has never been so fierce.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The most potent group, the IMU, which includes Russian converts to Islam, is determined to build a Caliphate on former Soviet territory much as ISIL has already done in Iraq. The IMU has been joined by Chechen and Daghestani militants who are still at war with Russia and pose a direct threat to Russia itself, just as the Uighur Muslim militants from Xinjiang province in China, who are now fighting with the Taliban, pose a threat to China. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Russia has outlined no strategic options of its own or adequate explanations for all the negative aspirations that it espouses. Every country in the world believes that a military victory against the Taliban is now impossible, and only by bringing the Taliban to the table can their support to the IMU and other groups be stopped. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span>Russia persists on ignoring reality and the facts on the ground in favour of a policy of </span><em>niet</em><span> (no) - a policy which few understand.</span> Increasingly, the global community is having to find ways to work around Russia rather than through it, but that may not be sustainable - either for Russia or for the West or for Central Asia. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The entire region is fully combustible and if it erupts, it could well cause the kind of upheaval and violence we are seeing in the Middle East today - even as experts still assess the extent to which the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has actually penetrated South and Central Asia. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Ahmed Rashid is the author of five books on Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Business leaders gathered in Addis Ababa on November 8 and <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29967124\" target=\"_blank\">pledged $28.5m to help the African Union</a> mobilise, train and deploy healthcare workers in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to fight the spread of Ebola.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">So far, African countries have pledged to send over 2,000 health workers to the affected countries. This includes teams of doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, lab technicians and the necessary support staff. In addition, the health workers need functioning equipment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The complexity and scale of such an operation is qualitatively different from activities such as food relief. It therefore requires careful planning and systematic execution in regions with limited functioning basic or medical infrastructure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Funding is only part of the resources needed to deploy the health workers. The bulk of the needs include training health workers, sourcing medical supplies, providing logistical support and extending insurance cover for volunteers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">To bring in different competencies, the chairperson of the African Union, Dr Nkozasana Dlamini-Zuma, convened the November 8 Africa Business Round-table on Ebola in Addis Ababa. The round-table were Dr Donald round-table, president of the African Development Bank, and Dr Carlos Lopes, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Limits exposed</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Africa has historically relied on government agencies and civil society to respond to emergencies, but the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has exposed the limits of this model. The initial response to the outbreak was sluggish, poorly funded and suffered from serious logistical challenges. Government actions to contain the outbreak by stopping flights backfired as no supplies could reach the affected areas. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Many observers have argued that reductions in funding accounted for the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/world-health-organisation-botched-ebola-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophic failure</a> of the World Health Organization (WHO) to contain the outbreak. This may be true but the real issue is that the scale of operations needed to safeguard public health in any country cannot be outsourced to international organisations. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">These entities do not have analytical, technical, financial, logistical, and organisational capabilities to do the job. The private sector does.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Right from the outset the private sector insisted on a clear goal around which to rally support. The fact that the African Union is headed by a medical doctor brought unique technical expertise to the assessment of the needs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Dr Dlamini-Zuma insisted on the urgency to train and deploy health workers through established government machinery. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We can, we must and will defeat Ebola, but we must also do more and do it faster,\" she said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Leadership in mobilising private sector engagement was provided by Strive Masiyiwa, founder of the global telecommunications firm Econet Wireless. The roundtable was attended by CEOs from a wide spectrum of industries covering banking, telecommunications, mining, energy, and services.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Commitment to long-term response</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">By the time of the meeting, considerable groundwork had been done. Probably the most important aspect of the roundtable was a commitment by the participants to a long-term response to the Ebola crisis. The pledges were only the beginning of process that will include the economic reconstruction of the affected countries. The roundtable will become an annual African Union event focused on strengthening cooperation between government and the private sector.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The fund is established under the auspices of the African Union Foundation and will be managed by the African Development Bank. A governing body is being set up to oversee the operations of the fund. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The long-term approach taken by the private sector includes a pledge to support the creation of a research institute on infectious diseases. This pledge opens up opportunities to extend cooperation to universities and other research institutes. The circle of interactions will, in the future, include government, enterprises and academia with a focus on problem-solving. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The roundtable also expressed concern over the impact of stigmatisation on economic recovery. As Lopes noted, stigmatisation \"is hurting not just those suffering from Ebola, but the continent as a whole\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But he also offered an optimistic outlook by noting that West Africa's growth continues to be robust despite the outbreak. The sub-region recorded the highest growth rate of any part of Africa in 2013, and is projected to remain above 6 percent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The whole of West Africa accounts for close to a third of Africa's GDP with the three affected countries representing less than 1 percent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"In fact, even if all the three countries were to register zero growth it would dent only 0.19 percent of the West African GDP and 0.05 percent of Africa as a whole,\" Lopes noted.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The overall mood of at the round-table was about Africa taking ownership and remaining optimistic. As Dr Kaberuka said: \"Ebola is first and foremost our problem. Before relying on international aid, we must first encourage Africans to take action.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Though tragic, Ebola has forced Africa to rediscover its own inner capabilities and find novel ways of harnessing it. The way ahead will involve closer interactions between government, business and academia. It is a new beginning for Africa.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i><em>Calestous Juma is Dr Martin Luther King, Jr Visiting Professor at the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">When I recently met up in Beirut with James Connell, the defence attorney for <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.therenditionproject.org.uk/global-rendition/the-detainees/amnar-al-baluchi-(ali-abdul-aziz-ali).html\" target=\"_blank\">9/11 suspect <span class=\"InternalLink\">Ammar al-Baluchi</span></a>, he recalled his August 2013 visit to Guantanamo Bay's clandestine Camp Seven as follows: \"In the most secret picnic of all time, Ammar was our host.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Connell is the only lawyer to have ever been permitted to meet with a client in the facility, which houses five 9/11 suspects in addition to 10 other \"high-value\" detainees. The \"picnic\" came about when the detainees learned that Connell and two colleagues were going to be without food for the duration of their 12-hour incursion.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The prisoners promptly donated their own meals, and Baluchi advised Connell on which components were more edible than others and which could be improved with lemon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">It's nothing short of remarkable, of course, that someone subjected to intensely dehumanising treatment over a long period of time hasn't had every ounce of humanity leached out of him. Abducted by the United States in 2003 in Pakistan, Baluchi was held at one or more \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/cia-black-sites/\" target=\"_blank\">black sites</a>\" abroad, where he underwent torture by the CIA prior to being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Manic classification scheme</span></span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As if the torture itself weren't enough, the US subsequently embarked on a manic classification scheme according to which - as Connell notes in a report on US non-compliance with the Convention against Torture - the government \"considers the observations and experiences of its victims of ill-treatment to be owned and controlled by the State\".</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In other words, if you've been tortured by the CIA, you're not allowed to talk about it with anyone aside from your lawyer, who in turn can be criminally prosecuted for sharing details of the events - such as location of torture or methods involved.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Lisa Hajjar, author of \"<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9480/new-texts-out-now_lisa-hajjar-torture_a-sociology-\" target=\"_blank\">Torture: A Sociology of Violence and Human Rights</a>\" and the organiser of Connell's recent talk at the American University of Beirut, \"Is Guantanamo Bay a war crime?\" summed up the detainees' predicament: \"Their memories are classified.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">If the word \"totalitarian\" happens to spring to mind, rest assured that such thoughts have not yet been criminalised.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On November 12 and 13 in Geneva, the United Nations Committee against Torture will review the US' track record for the first time since 2006. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">They'll presumably have plenty to discuss, particularly in light of the continuing US opinion that 9/11 Guantanamo detainees aren't covered by the anti-torture convention, which emphasises victims' rights to complain about and seek redress for their ill treatment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Connell's report on the subject, which was submitted to the committee, describes point-blank current US motivations vis-a-vis these particular detainees: \"The State Party seeks to execute … men imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay before they can reveal the truth of their torture.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">It's this sort of cold-blooded approach that makes the obsession with force-feeding inmates all the more confounding; after all, why try so hard to keep folks alive if you're just going to kill them?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">According to Connell, the committee will also review the idea of force-feeding itself as a form of torture. Although denied by the US, the validity of this classification is pretty much a no brainer for anyone who can imagine being <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/13/guantanamo-bay-hunger-strike-forced-feeding\" target=\"_blank\">shackled to a chair and having tubes rammed down their nostrils and into their stomachs.</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">But again, the force-feeding frenzy to prevent prisoners from dying of hunger in US custody - something that apparently constitutes a red line as far as upkeep of the national image goes - raises the question of why the same red line doesn't apply to torture in the first place, or to the maintenance of illegal prisons, the slaughter of civilians via drone strikes, or the launching of devastating wars under false pretences.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On a roll</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Baluchi is <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10018-abd-al-aziz-ali\" target=\"_blank\">accused of war crimes</a> for allegedly wiring funds that ultimately contributed to the execution of the 9/11 attacks. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">However, the ample evidence supporting an affirmative answer to Connell's question: \"Is Guantanamo Bay a war crime?\" suggests that the accusations against Baluchi also qualify as an extreme case of projection.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">That the US regularly violates the Geneva Conventions stipulating humane treatment for prisoners becomes even more glaringly obvious when we consider that the majority of the detainees at Guantanamo have never been charged with a crime and have furthermore been cleared for release.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Of course, the US government has auto-endowed itself with the powers to exempt its enemies from the protections afforded by Geneva. But it's unlikely such measures will enhance \"national security\", the catchphrase perennially invoked to justify the trampling of basic rights worldwide.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Instead, by obsessively classifying information regarding its abuse of detainees, the US is not disappearing its crimes but rather multiplying them - and in doing so, enhancing conditions for ever more radical responses.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Belen Fernandez is the author of The Imperial Messenger: Thomas Friedman at Work, published by Verso.
